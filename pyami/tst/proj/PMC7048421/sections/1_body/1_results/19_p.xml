<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For the baseline cell, the capacity loss at elevated temperatures is mainly due to SEI growth on the anode side and solvent oxidation on the cathode side. As a consequence, the DCR increases markedly with cycle number (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the case of SEB cells, the DCR of the fresh cell is initially much larger than the baseline cell; however, its rate of increase is much slower due to the protective coating on both the anode and cathode (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 (C and D)</xref> shows discharge curves of the fresh SEB cell versus the aged cell, respectively. Because of its DCR increase with cycle number, SEB-3 shows slight power fade after 2821 cycles at 60&#176;C. In contrast, the baseline cell shows a drastic DCR increase and, hence, substantial power loss within only 556 cycles (fig. S6). For all the SEB cells with TAP additive, their DCRs increase linearly and increased additive content leads to higher DCR in fresh cells but slower DCR evolution with cycle number (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The SEB cells do not produce gas during cycling tests, yielding more safety than the baseline cell. In addition, cells containing TAP produce less gas during formation than the baseline cell (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>).</p>
