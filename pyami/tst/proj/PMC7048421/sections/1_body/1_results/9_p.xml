<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The addition of the nickel foil increases cell mass by 1.3%, while the ratio of DCRs in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Eq. 1</xref> is the relative power presented in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> at 60&#176;C. On the basis of these values, the power density is not reduced but rather increased by a factor of 2.02, 1.79, and 1.37 in the case of SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3, respectively. Thus, in the case of SEB-3 with the highest internal resistance, the power density is still 37% higher than the baseline cell operated at room temperature.</p>
