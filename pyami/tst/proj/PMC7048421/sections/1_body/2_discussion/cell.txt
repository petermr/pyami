In the context of electric vehicles, introduction of the SEB yields a substantial gain in energy density and cost reduction at the pack level due to (i) simplified or entirely eliminated thermal management system; (ii) enhanced safety of SEB cells, thus enabling removal of some or all safety devices installed in a battery pack; and (iii) simplified battery management system due to SEB cells always operating at a single, constant temperature, rendering estimation of SOC, state of power, state of health, etc. oversimplified. We believe that 25 to 30% gain in energy density and 30% reduction in cost for SEB battery packs are possible without introducing new chemistry or cell manufacturing.
