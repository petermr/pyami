# pyami
Semantic Reader of the Scientific Literature.

A scientific article is not a single dumb file; it can be transformed into many semantic, useful sub-documents. `pyami` is a Python framework for doing this; it reads the scientific literature in bulk, transforms, searches and and analyses the contents.

### status
This is in very active alpha development and early documentation will appear on the Wiki.

# overview
* `pyami` is a personal (client-side) tool that users can customise for their own needs and visions. It does not reply on remote service providers, though it can make its own use of Open sites. 

# scope
* `pyami` can collect documents (of any sort) into a corpus or `CProject`. 
* `pyami` has tools for filtering, cleaning, normalizing a corpus
* `pyami` can search this corpus by filenames, filetypes, document structure and content 
* content can include metadata, text, tables, diagrams, math, chemistry, references and (in some cases) citations
* searching uses words, phrases, dictionaries, and image content (vectors and pixels)
* search results can be transformed, filtered, aggregated, and used for iterative enhancement ("snowballing")

# architecture
* downloaded documents (a corpus) are stored on your disk in a folder/directory (a CProject`)
* each document (`CTree`) in a `CProject` is a living subtree of many labelled text subsections (text, paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words) and images (`png`) . This is flexible (new types and subdirectories) can be added by users).
* the CTree is held on disk and can be further processed by other programs (e.g. pandas, tesseract (image2text), matplotlib
* a commandline supports many operations for searching, and transforming.
* a GUI (`ami-gui`) is layered on the commandline to help navigation, query building and visualisation.
* the commandline can be used by workflow tools such as Jupyter Notebooks
* The `pyami` code is packaged as a Python library for use by other tools

# components
There are several independent components. Many of these are customised for beginners. They can be referenced by symbols to avoid having to remember filenames. Users customise this with environment variables (often preset).
* project. The CProject holding the corpus. Users can have as many projects as they like.
* dictionary. Many searches use dictionaries and often several are used at once. There are currently over 50 dictionaries in a network but it's easy to create your own.
* code. (in Python3)

  --patt PATT [PATT ...]
                        patterns to search with (NYI); regex may need quoting

# getting started
There are an alpha series of commandline examples which show the operation of the system. Currently:
````
 examples args: ['examples.py']
choose from:
gl => globbing files
pd => convert pdf to text
pa => split pdf text into paragraphs
sc => split xml into sections
sl => split oil26 project into sections
se => split text to sentences
fi => simple filter (not complete)
sp => extract species with italics and regex (not finalised)

all => all examples
````
