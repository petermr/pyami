Rather, it involves expediting the pace of change (speed) while also removing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and high emissions (quality and depth) and aligning the interests of different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth). One key to enabling deep and broad transitions is integrating the views of different government agencies, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in transition processes. Another critical driver of deep and broad transitions is engaging and empowering workers, youth,  women,  the  poor,  minorities  and  marginalized  stakeholders  in  just,  equitable  and  inclusive processes. The result of such processes will be the transformation of large-scale socioeconomic systems to restore the health and well-being of the planet and the people on it.   </span></div><div style="" id="id1434"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1435">Section  17.1  begins  by  reviewing  how  climate  and  sustainability  issues  have  been  discussed  in  the Intergovernmental  Process  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  as  well  as  international  climate  change  and sustainable development processes at different levels.

From the early stages of the IPCC assessment process, this challenge and the inherent link between climate  change  and  sustainable  development  have  been  well  recognized.  For  example,  the  First Assessment Report (FAR) highlighted the relevance of sustainable development for climate policy. The Second Assessment Report (SAR) went further to include equity issues in its presentation of sustainable development. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Banuri et al. 2001) made the link even stronger, noting that "parties have a right to and should promote sustainable development" (as stated in the text of the  UNFCCC  2015  (Article  3.4)),  and  offering  an early review  of  studies  integrating  sustainable development and climate change. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (Sathaye et al. 2007) added an additional perspective to these interconnections, acknowledging the existence of a two-way relationship between sustainable development and climate change. </span></div><div style="" id="id1469"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1470">The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Denton et al. 2014; Fleurbaey et al. 2014) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5</span><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1472">&#61616;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1473">C (IPCC 2018; Roy et al. 2018a) have arguably made the strongest links between climate and sustainable development to date. One of the key messages of AR5 was that the implementation  of  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  could  help  promote  sustainable development,  and  it  emphasized  the  need  for  transformational  changes  in  this  regard.  AR5  also concluded  that  the  link  between  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  is  cross-cutting  and complex, and that thus the impacts of climate change are threatening the efforts being made to achieve sustainable development.

<div style="" id="id1676"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1677">Despite the clear links between sustainable development and climate change being recognised from the early stages of the IPCC, climate change has often been portrayed as an environmental problem to be addressed chiefly by environmental ministries (Brown et al. 2007; Munasinghe 2007; Swart and Raes 2007).  However,  this  perception  has  evolved  over  time.  It  is  now  increasingly  common  to  see governments and other actors understand the wider ramifications of a changing climate for sustainable development. In a growing number of studies, work on climate policies and just transitions towards sustainable  development  are  framed  as going  hand in  hand  (Fuso  Nerini  et  al.  2019;  Dugarova  and G&#252;lasan 2017; Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Schramade 2017; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1686"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1687">17.1.2  Integrating  Climate  Change  and  Sustainable  Development  in  International </span></div><div style="" id="id1689"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1690">Policymaking Processes  </span></div><div style="" id="id1692"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1693">Among  the  reasons  for  the  growing  realization  of  these  interdependencies  are  milestones  in international climate and sustainable development processes. As outlined in Chapter 14, the year 2015 was  a  turning  point  due  to  two  agreements:  1)  the  Paris  Agreement;  and  2)  the  2030  Agenda  on Sustainable Development and its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Farzaneh et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1699"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1700">Following  a  long  history  of  references  to  sustainable  development  in  the  UNFCCC  and  related agreements,  the  Paris  Agreement  helped  to  strengthen  the  links  between  climate  and  sustainable development by emphasizing  that sustainability is related to its objectives (Sindico 2016; UNFCCC 2016). One of the ways that it helped tighten this link is by institutionalizing bottom-up pledges and the review  architecture.  Toward  this  end,  the  Paris  Agreement  instituted  nationally  determined contributions  (NDCs)  as  vehicles  through  which  countries  make  pledges  and  demonstrate  their commitment to climate action. Although there was no clear guidance on what should be included in the NDCs, some of the requirements were elaborated in the Paris Rule Book (see above, Chapter 14). Some of the submitted NDCs included only mitigation efforts, but others set out mitigation and adaptation goals aligning NDC commitments to national planning processes, while yet others mentioned links with the SDGs. </span></div><div style="" id="id1712"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1713">Another  way  that  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the  NDCs  could  strengthen  their  links  to  sustainable development is to update country-specific climate pledges. Countries are free to choose their targets and the means and instruments with which to implement them. A core feature of the NDCs was that countries submit NDCs every five years, giving them an opportunity to assess themselves relative to other  countries,  raise  their  ambitions  and  learn  from  their  peers.  Moreover,  it  was  emphasized  that </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1719">countries should not &#8220;backslide&#8221; in subsequent NDCs, thus ensuring that countries should always be </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1721">forward-looking in respect of increasing their ambitions to deliver the Paris Goals. H&#246;hne et al. (2017) found  that,  in  developing  countries  especially,  the  NDC  preparation  process  has  improved  national climate policy-making.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1725"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1726">Despite some favourable reviews, several assessments of specific countries</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1727">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1728"> NDCs (Andries et al. 2017; Rogelj  et  al.  2016;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016)  have  assessed  that  those  submitted  for  2020-2030  are insufficient for delivering on the Paris goals. Updated and/or new NDCs were therefore submitted by end  of  2020.  However,  an  assessment  of  those  NDCs  revealed  that  the  level  of  ambition  was significantly lower than the goals of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCO 2020; see also this Chapter). One of the urgent calls in Paris was to assess the impacts and efforts that need to be undertaken to keep global  warming  well  below  2&#176;C  in  relation  to  pre-industrial  levels  and  evaluate  related  global greenhouse-gas  emission  pathways  (UNFCCC  2015).  Although  the  initial  NDCs  fell  short  of  these goals,  the  idea  was  that  NDCs  would  be  living  documents  that  could  ratchet  up  climate  action  and ambition. </span></div><div style="" id="id1739"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1740">Countries  have  also  started  to  take  actions  on  the  SDGs  themselves  (Antwi-Agyei  et  al.  2018a; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018). The SDGs were perceived as a novel approach to development and as establishing  a  universal  agenda  for  the  transformation  of  development  patterns  and  socioeconomic systems. At their core, the SDGs hold that building an integrated framework for action necessitates </span></div><div style="" id="id1757"/><div style="" id="id1878"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1879">addressing  the  economic,  social  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable  development  in  an integrated manner (Biermann et al. 2017; Kanie and Biermann 2017). The SDGs take multiple elements of development into account in aiming to offer coherent, well-integrated, overarching approaches to a range of sustainability challenges, including climate change. </span></div><div style="" id="id1884"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1885">One way a link is made between climate and the SDGs is through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). Paralleling the bottom-up orientation of the Paris Agreement and the NDCs, every year approximately forty  countries  voluntarily  share  their  VNRs  with  the  international  community  at  the  High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). Even more flexible than the NDCs, the VNRs can include content such as a summary of key policies and measures that are intended to achieve the SDGs, a list of the means of implementation that support the SDGs, and related challenges and needs. The VNRs also often cover SDG 13 (on climate change) as well as many other issues connected with climate change. Even with these links, implementation of the SDGs should be mentioned as part of national development processes reflecting  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1894">different  countries&#8217;  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1895">different  priorities,  visions  and  plans  (Hanson  and  Puplampu  2018; Marcotullio et al. 2018; OECD 2016; Puplampu et al. 2017; Srikanth 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id1898"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1899">Yet  another  way  that  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  underlines  the  importance  of capturing synergies is its calls for policy coherence (goals 17 and 14). Policy coherence and integration between  sectors  are  two  of  the  most  critical  factors  in  breaking  down  the  silo  mode  of  working  of different sectors. Working across climate and other sustainability agendas is essential to coherence.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1904"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1905">A final way that the sustainability and climate agendas have been linked is through vertical integration. Following a similar trend that appeared with Agenda 21, for which many cities adopted local plans, a growing number of cities have introduced Voluntary Local Reviews. The VLRs resemble the VNRs, but  place  the  emphasis  on  local  actions  and  needs  regarding  the  SDGs  (and  some  links  to  climate change)  (Ort&#237;z-Moya  et  al.  2021).  The  2019  SDG  Report  shows  that  150  countries  have  developed national  urban  plans,  almost  half  of  them  also  being  in  the  implementation  phase  (United  Nations General Assembly 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id1913"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1914">17.1.3 Integrating Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Other Policymaking </span></div><div style="" id="id1916"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1917">Processes  </span></div><div style="" id="id1919"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1920">Other non-UN-led initiatives involving international organizations or clusters of countries have also helped to raise the issue of sustainable development as a framework for mitigation. The OECD, for instance,  assesses  different  types  of  investments  and  economic  activities  with  reference  to  their significance for environmental sustainability (OECD 2020), while G20 countries have drawn up action agendas  with  sustainable  development  at  the  (UToronto  2016).  Meanwhile,  the  Petersberg  Climate Dialogue, a political movement convened by major country-group representatives launched in 2010 by the  German  government,  has  also  called  for  sustainability  to  be  an  intrinsic  part  of  the  transition (UNFCCO 2020; BMU 2018).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1929"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1930">Due in part to the shifting orientation of these international processes, there  is growing evidence of action  on  climate  change  and  sustainable  development  at  other  levels  of  decision-making.  National policies  often  aim  to  implement  climate  change  policies  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development (Chimhowu et al. 2019;  Chirambo  2018;  ECLAC  2017;  Fuseini and  Kemp 2015;  Galli  et  al.  2018; Haywood  et  al.  2019;  Ministry  of  Environment  of  Jordan  2016;  McKenzie  and  Abdulkadri  2018; UNDESA 2016, 2017, 2018; UN Women 2017). Some countries are adjusting their existing policies to build on themes familiar to sustainable development (Lucas et al. 2016), including renewable energy and energy efficiency (Fastenrath and Braun 2018; Kousksou et al. 2015), urban planning (Gorissen et al. 2018; Loorbach et al. 2016; Mendizabal et al. 2018), health systems (Pencheon 2018; Roschnik et </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1940">al. 2017) and agricultural systems (Lipper and Zilberman 2018; Shaw and Roberts 2017). Cross-cutting and  integrated  approaches,  such  as  the  circular  economy,  have  also  been  gaining  traction  in  some European countries (EESC 2015) and G20 countries (Noura et al. 2020). Many of these efforts have also extended up to the regional and down to the local level (Gorissen et al. 2018; Hess 2014; Shaw and Roberts 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1956"/><div style="" id="id2076"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2077">There has also been a shift to actors outside government aligning climate with sustainable development. An  assessment  by  Hoyer  (2020)  found  that  collective  action  against  climate  change  by  businesses, governments  and  civil  society,  reinforced  through  partnerships  and  coalitions  across  departments, industries  and  supply  chains,  can  deliver  significant  development  impacts.  In  order  for  this  diverse collection of stakeholders to take action, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed from a linear model of knowledge-generation to an interdisciplinary model that co-produces knowledge (Liu et al. 2019). In fact,  some  have  argued  that  accelerating  just  transitions  for  purposes  of  sustainable  development requires the involvement of several actors, institutions and disciplines (Delina and Sovacool 2018). Not only do these roles need to be discussed more thoroughly (Kern and Rogge 2016; den Elzen et al. 2019), but it is also important to survey different views on transitions and transformations. A variety of theories that are useful for explaining the causes and constraints regarding transitions are examined in Section 17.2. </span></div><div style="" id="id2090"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id2091">17.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id2093">Accelerating Transitions in the Context of Sustainable Development: </span></div><div style="" id="id2095"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id2096">Definitions and Theories </span></div><div style="" id="id2098"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2099">This section focuses on how different theoretical frameworks can help us understand and explain what is meant by accelerating transitions in the context of sustainable development.

This set of factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the momentum needed for transformations.

That overview  describes  how transitions can break through lock-ins and result in a transformation.</span></div><div style="" id="id2134"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2135">While there may be a relatively consistent set of transition dynamics for all countries, pathways are likely to vary across and even within countries. This variation is due to different development levels, starting points, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2139">other contextual factors. Given the diversity of contributing factors, a sustainable transition is likely to be a complex and multi-faceted process which cannot be reduced to a single dimension (K&#246;hler et al. 2019). Even with this multi-dimensionality, transition processes are likely to gain speed and become more sustainable as decision-makers adopt targeted policies and other interventions. Many disciplines have reflected on the roles  of and relative influence on the policies and interventions that can drive transitions. The following discussion describes this diversity of views with a survey of how prominent lines of economic, psychological, institutional and systems thinking explain transitions. Though these disciplines differ greatly, they often stress that leveraging synergies and managing trade-offs between climate change and sustainable development can help advance a transition. </span></div><div style="" id="id2149"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2150">17.2.1 Economics </span></div><div style="" id="id2152"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2153">This  section  concentrates  on  economic  explanations  for  transitions.

Many  modern  economic  systems  may  nonetheless  struggle  to  deliver  these benefits due to major disruptions and shocks such as climate change  (Heal 2020). One way to limit disruptions to free markets are targeted interventions in free markets such as taxes or regulation. These targeted  interventions  motivate  firms  and  other  entities  to  internalize  GHGs  and  other  pollutants, potentially paving the way for a sustainable transition (Arrow et al. 2004; Chichilnisky and Heal 1998).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2243"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2244">A  related  line  of  thought  common  to  economic  explanations  involves  the  principles  of  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2245">&#8220;weak sustainability&#8221;.

One  way  to  capitalize  on  this  substitution  is  to  target  investments  at technological change, green growth, and research and development. Targeted investments in the form of subsidies can encourage the substitution of exhaustible by non-exhaustible resources.

There is hence a need to capitalize on possible synergies such as those with other development priorities and trade-offs, for example, the exhaustion of non-substitutable resources. Capturing these synergies and managing these trade-offs is consistent with sustainable development, a state where the needs of the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2263">present  generation  do  not  compromise  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2265">(Bruntland, WCED 1987).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2267"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2268">As  suggested  above,  aligning  climate  investments  with  other  sustainable  development  objectives  is critical  to  a  transition.  In  order  to  support  better  investments  in  sustainable  development,  financing schemes, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure schemes and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), can play important roles (Executive Summary in Chapter  15).  After  COVID-19,  economic  recovery  packages  have  increased  government-led investments  (Section  1.3.3  in  Chapter  1),  which  could  potentially  be  aligned  with  sustainable development. Technological change and innovation are considered key drivers of economic growth and of many aspects of social progress (Section 16.1 in Chapter 16), but if technological innovation policies are  coordinated  with  the  shift  to  sustainable  development  pathways,  then  the  economic  benefits  of technological  change  could  come  at  the cost of  increasing  climate risks  (Chapter  16,  Gossart  2015) Chapter 16, 16:1; Alarc&#243;n and Vos 2015). The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, including emissions of GHGs, are greatly influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes. Innovation and technological transformations present trade-offs that create externalities and rebound effects.  This  suggests  that  a  sustainable  future  for  people  and  nature  requires  rapid,  radical  and transformative societal change by integrating the technical, governance, financial and societal aspects  (Chapter 16, 16.1; P&#246;rtner et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2285"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2286">One area that is pertinent to transitions and has received considerable attention in economic modelling </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2288">involving  climate  change  is  innovation.  In  particular,  some  studies  have  shown  how  low-cost innovations  and  improvements  in  end-use  technologies  have  significant  potential  for  emissions reductions as well as sustainable development (Wilson et al. 2019). Currently information technologies are improving rapidly, and IoT, AI and Big Data can all contribute to other development needs. This is often the case in end-use sectors, as the benefits accrue directly to the individuals who use the new innovations. The achievement and widespread deployment of fully autonomous cars, for example, will bring  about  broader  car-  and  ride-sharing  with  negative  or  low  additional  costs  compared  to  more conventional approaches to car ownership, with their typically very low load factors.

Yet  marginal  damage  from  climate  change  is  notoriously uncertain,  and  economic  theories  do  not  always  reflect  climate-related  damage.  On  the  other  hand, marginal abatement mitigation costs impose additional costs in the short term. These added costs can cause productivity in capital to decline through increases in the prices of energy and products in which the energies are embodied. These increased costs can restrict the ability to invest in and achieve the sustainable development priorities. However, precisely the opposite can occur when innovation reduces additional costs or achieves negative costs. If technological innovation leads to the accumulation of capital and productivity increases due to the substitution of energy, material and labour, these are likely to deliver sustainable development and climate mitigation benefits. </span></div><div style="" id="id2513"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2514">17.2.2 Institutions, Governance, and Political Economy  </span></div><div style="" id="id2516"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2517">This  subsection  focuses  on  institutions,  governance  and  the  political  economy.  Institutional  and governance arrangements can influence which actors possess authority, as well as how motivated they are to cooperate in transition processes that are directed at finding solutions to climate change and other sustainability challenges. Often cooperation is enabled when policy frameworks or institutions align climate change with the political and economic interests of national governments, cities or businesses, and when institutional and governance arguments that support that alignment expand the scale of the transitions. However, there may also be political and economic interests and structures that can lock in unsustainable  development  patterns,  frustrate this  alignment and  slow  down  transitions  (Haas  2021; Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2527"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2528">An  extensive  literature  has  examined  how  the  international  climate  agreements  and  architecture influence collaboration  across countries regarding climate and sustainable development to support a transition (Bradley 2005). For example, international institutions offer opportunities for governments and other actors to share new perspectives on integrated solutions (Cole 2015). For some observers, however,  decades  of  difficulties  in  crafting  a  comprehensive  climate-change  agreement  and  the resulting  fragmented  climate-policy  landscape  have  been  inimical  to  the  collaboration  needed  for  a transition  (Chapter 1 and 13; Nasiritousi and B&#228;ckstrand 2019; van Asselt 2014).

For example, in contrast to the relatively </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2542">top-down Kyoto Protocol, the bottom-up pledge and review architecture of the Paris Agreement has prompted  national  governments  to  integrate  climate  change  with  other  sustainable  development priorities  (Nachmany  and  Setzer  2018;  Townshend  et  al.  2013).  Concrete  examples  included incorporating the SDGs into the NDCs as an international response to climate change (The Energy and Resources  Institute  2017)  or  bringing  climate  into  sustainable  development  strategies  and  so-called voluntary national reviews (VNRs) as part of the SDG and 2030 Agenda process (Elder and King 2018; Elder and Bartalini 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2550"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2551">Another branch of institutional research is concerned with the interactions between multiple levels of governance.

Such  support  has  become  increasingly  important  during  the pandemic,  as  national  government  transfer  funds  for  investments  in  climate-friendly  infrastructure, transport systems and energy systems. This line of thinking is supported by calls to strengthen vertical and horizontal integration within and across government agencies and stakeholders in ways that can enhance policy coherence (Amanuma et al. 2018; OECD 2018, 2019). The incoherence or misalignment between national and local fiscal institutions and policies can restrict the ability of local governments to secure resources for climate-friendly investments. Such investments are particularly likely to flow, as more local governments have adopted net zero targets, climate emergency declarations and action plans  that  can  stimulate  innovations  (Davidson  et  al.  2020).  Others  have  seen  greater  potential  for collaboration and innovation, with more multi-centred or polycentric forms of governance that lead to the  formulation  and  dissemination  of  transformative  solutions  to  climate  and  other  environmental challenges  (Ostrom 2008).  Though  much  of the  above  governance  research  has focused  on  western countries, there are some applications in other regions and countries such as China (Gu et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2711"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2712">Yet another set of channels facilitating integration between climate and other concerns are networks of like-minded actors working across administrative borders and physical boundaries.

Other  forms  of  multi-stakeholder partnerships focusing on issues with strong climate synergies, such as forms of air pollution known as short-lived climate pollutants (Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)) or transport (Sustainable Low Carbon Transport Partnership (SLoCaT)), take their cue from global scientific communities or civic-minded advocacy groups that transmit knowledge across boundaries (Keck and Sikkink 1999).  There is also scope for suggesting that the international climate regime serves a Global Framework for Climate Action (GFCA) in helping orchestrate the multilateral climate regime and non-state and subnational initiatives  (Chan  and  Pauw  2014),  though  questions  remain  about  its  actual  impacts  on  mitigation (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2738"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2739">Policymaking institutions and networks are themselves policies.

A  similar </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2745">discussion  about  synergies  and  conflicts  has  been  raised  on  the  relationship  between  resilience  and sustainability  (Marchese  et  al.  2018).

Following these calls, some governments have aimed to address climate change and sustainability jointly with coherent and integrated approaches to achieving these agendas (Chimhowu et al. 2019), although for some countries (SIDS) this has proven more challenging  (Scobie 2016). </span></div><div style="" id="id2757"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2758">Though the above work tends to downplay politics and business, others suggest that political economy should feature prominently in transitions.

These vested interests can lock in status quo policies in countries where political systems offer interest groups more opportunities to veto or overturn climate- or eco-friendly proposals (Madden 2014). Companies with a strong interest in earning profits and building competitiveness from conventional fossil fuel-based energy systems have particularly strong incentives to capture politicians and agencies (Meckling and Nahm 2018). Such strategies can be particularly powerful when combined with concerns over job losses and dislocation, preventing transitions from gaining traction (Haas 2021; Mattioli et al. 2020; Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Power 2016).  </span></div><div style="" id="id2893"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2894">This suggests that politics can be an impediment to change: other studies argue instead that politics can be harnessed to drive transitions forward.

To illustrate, renewable feed-in tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial in wind and solar power technologies making the breakthrough.

The review  suggests  that  there  are  several  differences  between  these  various  perspectives.  Whether individuals, organisations, markets or sociotechnical systems drive or undermine transitions is a key distinction. These differences have implications for the evidence these claims draw on in support of their arguments. For instance, some of the explanations tend to employ qualitative evidence to explain changes in attitudes at the individual or community levels as paving the way for broader changes to cultures and belief systems. Others assess how institutional arrangements can be reformed in order to align climate with the sustainable development agenda to enable a transition.  </span></div><div style="" id="id3437"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3438">While there are indeed significant differences between explanations, there are also important parallels. Such  parallels  begin  with  a  shared  emphasis  on  synergies  and  trade-offs  between  climate  and sustainable development. Most explanations tend to underline the importance of synergies in aligning the  climate  with  broader  sustainability  agendas.  Most  importantly,  many  of  the  explanations  are complementary with the systems-level discussion in that they offer a broad framework, while economic, psychological and governance theories offer more specific insights.

It is also being realised that, under the Paris Agreement, climate change policies should be integrated into sustainable development agendas, while  the  UN  2030  Agenda  as  well  includes  SDG  13  on  climate  actions.  In  this  way,  both  UN agreements provide joint opportunities for systematic transitions in support of both climate change and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3562">sustainable development. Achievement of the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goals will require a rapid and deep </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3564">worldwide  transition  in  all  GHG  emissions  sectors,  including  land-use,  energy,  industry,  buildings, transport and cities, as well as in consumption and behaviour (United Nations Environment Programme 2019). Meeting the goals of such a transformation requires that the long-term targets and pathways to fulfil the stabilization scenarios play an important role in guiding the direction and pathways of short-term transitions. There is therefore a need for long- and short-term policies and investment decisions to be closely coordinated. </span></div><div style="" id="id3571"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3572">In  the  context  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  countries  have  submitted  their  initial  plans  for  the decarbonization of their economies to the UNFCCC in the form of their so-called national determined contributions  (NDCs).  The  ambitions  of  the  NDCs  are  closely  related  to  the  ongoing  UNFCCC negotiations over the financial measures and forms of compensation. Although the Paris Agreement </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3577">emphasizes the links between climate policies and sustainable development, the UN&#8217;s 2030 Agenda </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3579">and the SDGs are not very well represented at present in the NDCs, according to Fuso Nerini et al. (2019). Very few of the NDCs include any reference to the SDGs, which  Fuso Nerini et al.  (2019) highlight as a barrier to the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement, which induces them to call for a more holistic policy approach. Campagnolo and Davide (2019) have assessed the impacts of the submitted NDCs on poverty eradication and inequalities of income based on empirical research and a global CGE model. One conclusion is that the NDCs of less developed countries would tend to reduce </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3586">poverty alleviation, but this can be offset if international financial support is provided for the mitigation actions.  </span></div><div style="" id="id3589"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3590">The alignment of climate-policy targets in the NDCs with sustainable development has been assessed by means of integrated assessment models (IAMs), macroeconomic and sectoral modelling. Iyer et al. (2018) based on IAM-based studies, the implications of framing NDCs being placed more narrowly on mitigation  targets  rather  than  on  a  framing  in  which  the  impacts  on  sustainable  development  were explicitly taken into consideration. It was thus concluded that some SDGs would be directly supported as a side benefit of the climate policy targets included in the NDCs, while other SDGs needed a special policy  design  going  beyond  narrow  climate  policy  objectives.  Iyer  et  al.  (2018)  also  assessed  the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3598">regional distribution of efforts in terms of domestic mitigation costs and SDG impacts and concluded that the geographical distribution of mitigation costs and SDG benefits were not similar, so a special effort would be needed to match climate policies and policies to meet the SDGs. Accordingly, a national decision-making perspective suggests that SDGs should be integrated into national climate policies. </span></div><div style="" id="id3675"/><div style="" id="id3794"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3795">The NDCs submitted to the Paris Agreement have demonstrated a lack of progress in meeting the long-term temperature goals.

Given the close link between the SDGs and climate-change policies, the current obstacles in meeting the former could also be a barrier to realizing transitions to low-carbon societies. Conversely, opportunities to leverage the SDGs  could  in  many  cases  involve  climate  actions,  since  policies  enabling  climate  adaptation  and mitigation  could  also  support  food  and  energy  security  and  water  conservation  if  they  were  well designed (see the detailed discussion in the section on synergies and trade-offs between climate policies and meeting the SDGs in section 17.3.3.7, Chapter 3 and IPCC 2018).These findings point to a specific need to align economic and social development perspectives, climate change and natural systems. While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and over time. These  priorities  are  strongly  linked  to  local  contexts  and  depend  on  which  dimension  of  the improvement in the well-being of people is considered to be the most urgent. Eradicating poverty and reducing  inequality  are  key  development  priorities  for  many  low-  and  middle-income  countries.

Accelerating investments particularly in low-income countries will be required to meet both the Paris goals  and  the  SDGs  (Section  15.6.7  in  Chapter  15).  The  mismatch  between  capital  and  investment needs, home bias considerations and differences in risk perceptions between rich and poor represent major challenges for private finance. Green bond markets and markets for sustainable financal products have increased significantly, and the landscape has continued to evolve since AR5 (Executive Summary in Chapter 15). Special efforts and activities are particularly required for raising finance in developing countries. </span></div><div style="" id="id3835"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3836">Based on the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC has invited countries to communicate their mid-century and  long-term  low  greenhouse-gas  emission-development  strategies  by  2020  (UNFCCC  2019).

Areas of focal modelling include green  investments,  technological  change,  employment  generation  and  the  performance  of  policy instruments, such as green taxes, subsidies, emission permits, investments and finance. Short- and long-term macroeconomic models have been used to assess the impacts of such policy instruments. Jaumotte et al. (2021) analyse the economic impacts on net zero emissions by 2050 with a focus on short-term economic policies and the integration of climate policies such as CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id4001">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4002"> taxes with green reform policies.

The early literature, including that on IAMs, and macroeconomic and sectoral models mainly focused on the co-benefits of mitigation policies in terms of reduced air pollution, energy security and to some extent employment generation security (IPCC 2014, 2018c; WGIII AR6 Chapter 6). Some models have been developed further with assessments  of  a  broader  range  of  the  joint  benefits  of  mitigation,  health,  water,  land-use  and  food security (Clarke et al. 2014; IPCC 2014, 2018; Kolstad et al. 2014). According to WGIII AR6 Chapter 1, there is a need to incorporate issues and enablers further, including a wide range of non-climate risks, varying forms of innovation, possibilities for behavioural and social change, feasible policies and equity issues (Executive Summary in Chapter 1). </span></div><div style="" id="id4018"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4019">IAMs  and  macroeconomic  models typically  calculate  mitigation  costs  based  on the assumption that markets internalise externalities like GHG emissions through carbon prices (Barker et al. 2016; IEA 2017,  2019).  Yet,  there  are  legitimate  questions  to  be  asked  about  whether  carbon-pricing  will  be efficient if markets are inefficient (World Bank 2019). However, market inefficiencies are difficult to integrate into the models. How GHG emissions taxes would actually work is thus quite uncertain based on the modelling studies (Barker et al. 2016; Fontana and Sawyer 2016; Meyer et al. 2018). Despite these limitations, the use of GHG emission taxes as an effective instrument based on modelling results in practice has implications for public policies and private-sector investments.  </span></div><div style="" id="id4028"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4029">Despite the shortcomings of conventional economic thought and models, already pointed out, improved models have demonstrated new perspectives on how mitigation costs can be assessed in macroeconomic models. For instance, while a conventional perspective might suggest that climate-change mitigation costs  can  limit  investments  in  sustainability  because  they  reduce  the  productivity  of  capital  by increasing energy prices and the products in which energies are embodied, another perspective is that innovation can imply increases in efficiency and that the substitution of energy, material and labour can lead to the accumulation of capital and productivity gains. This appears to occur with innovations in end-use  energy  applications  generating  emissions  reductions  and  delivering  on  other  sustainable development  benefits  (Wilson  et  al.  2019).  Similarly,  IAM  models  have  been  applied  to  model  the potential  for  low  energy  demand  scenarios  associated  with  demand-side  innovations  in  the  service sector. Grubler et al.  (2018) have developed a climate-friendly, low-energy demand (LED) scenario </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4041">which assumes information technology innovations such as the internet of things (IoT) and induced social changes such as the sharing economy. Nonetheless there are still very important limits on the degree to which highly aggregated IAM models and macroeconomic models can integrate ethics, equity and several other key policy-relevant aspects of sustainable development (Easterlin et al. 2010; Koch 2020).  A  key  limitation  in  this  context  is  that,  while  all  countries  share  the  totality  of  the  SDGs, development  priorities differ across  countries  and  over time.

Selected mitigation co-benefits and trade-offs are provided in relation to meeting the 1.5 degree temperature goal based on a subset of models and scenarios, despite many IAMs so far not having comprehensive coverage of the sustainable development goals (Rao et al. 2017; van Soest et al. 2019). There are several co-benefits of mitigation policies, including increased forest  cover  (SDG  15)  and  reduced  mortality  from  ambient  PM2.5  pollution  (SDG  3)  compared  to reference scenarios. However, mitigation policies can also cause higher food prices and thus increase the share of the global population at risk from hunger (SDG 2), while also relying on solid fuels (SDGs 7 &amp; 3) as side effects. It is then concluded in Section 3.7 of  Chapter 3, that these trade-offs can be balanced  through  targeted  support  measures  and/or  additional  SD  policies  (Bertram  et  al.  2018; Cameron et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id4661"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4662">The World in 2050 Initiative (TWI) includes a comprehensive assessment of technologies, economies and  societies  embodied  in  the  SDGs  (IIASA  2018).

However, studies show that replacing fossil fuels with renewables can have major synergies and trade-offs with a broader agenda of sustainable development (Swain and Karimu 2020), including land use and food security (McCollum et al. 2018), decent jobs and economic growth  (Swain  and  Karimu  2020).  Clarke  et  al.  (2014:Table  6.7)  provides  detailed  mapping  of  the sectoral  co-benefits  and  adverse  side-impacts  of  and  links  to  transformation  pathways.  In  Section 17.3.3.7 in this chapter, this is supplemented with a mapping of the synergies and trade-offs between the deployment of renewable energy and the SDGs.  </span></div><div style="" id="id4862"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4863">The general conclusion is that the potential co-benefits of renewable energy end-use measures outweigh the  adverse impacts  in  most sectors and  in  relation to  the  SDGs,  though  this  is  not  the case for  the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) sectors. Some locally negative economic impacts can result in increased energy costs and competition over land areas and water resources. Some sectors may also experience increasing unemployment as a consequence of the transition process. Although the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4869">deployment of renewable energy will generate a new industry and associated jobs and benefits in some areas and economies, these impacts will often not directly replace or offset activities in areas that have been heavily dependent on the fossil-fuel industry.  </span></div><div style="" id="id4873"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4874">The transition to low emission pathways will require policy efforts that also address the emissions that are locked into existing infrastructure like power plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already  in  use:  for  example,  today  coal-fired  power  plants  account  for  30%  of  all  energy-related emissions (IEA 2019). Over the past twenty years, Asia has accounted for 90% of all coal-fired capacity built  worldwide,  and  these  plants  have  potentially  long  operational  lifetimes  ahead  of  them.  In </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4880">developing economies in Asia, existing coal-fired plants are just twelve years old on average. There are three options for bringing down emissions from the existing stock of plants: to retrofit them with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) or biomass co-firing equipment; to repurpose them to focus on providing system adequacy and flexibility while reducing operations; and to retire them early.

Kefford et al. (2018) assess the early retirement of fossil-fuel power plants in the US, EU, China and India based on the IEA 2&#176;C scenario and conclude that a massive early retirement of coal-fired power plants is needed, and that two to three standard 500 MW generators will need to come offline every week for fifteen years. This high rate is the result of a very large deployment of coal-fired power plants from 2004 to 2012. The early phasing out of this infrastructure will result in a significant share of stranded assets (Ansari and Holz 2020) with an impact on workers, local communities, companies and governments (van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). The challenge is thus to manage a transition which delivers the rapid phasing out of existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure while also developing a new energy system based on low-carbon alternatives within a very short window of opportunity. </span></div><div style="" id="id5034"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5035">Chapter 6 similarly concludes that the transition towards a high penetration of renewable systems faces various  challenges  in  the  technical,  environmental  and  socio-economic  fields.

The long-term policy should target support to the local economy and workers to move beyond coal, including a strategic plan to transform the impacted area, investment  in  local  infrastructure  and  education,  and  preference  policies  to  incentivize  emerging businesses.

Many economies in transition and countries dependent on fossil fuels are going through turbulent times where asset and transition management will be critical  (UNEP/SEI 2020).

Second, failure to recognize the threat from stranded assets will result in new assets becoming stranded (Rempel and Gupta 2021).

In addition, other carbon-intensive activities can also run the risk of being stranded, such as cement, petrochemicals, steel and aviation  (Baron and David 2015). This is why stranded assets  are  often referred to as having a cascading impact on several other sectors. </span></div><div style="" id="id5636"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5637">Transitions  are  broad-based  and  complex,  involving  governance  structures,  institutions  and  climate vulnerabilities,  and there is  need to  include  historical responsibility,  resource  intensity  and  capacity differentials, thus relegating the debate across simplistic binary lines of developed versus developing countries (Carney 2016). Hence, transition processes will have to respond to several preconditions and structural inequalities related to climate finance, energy poverty, vulnerabilities and the broader macro-economic implications associated with managing the debt burden, fiscal deficits and uneven terms of development in developing countries. In addition to structural inequalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted energy and food systems to and reduced the speed at which developing countries can procure new low-carbon technologies and decouple economic growth from fossil fuels (Winkler 2020). For instance, global supply-chain transition costs might be lower when compared to in-country supply  chains,  as  became  evident  when  COVID-19  created  further  disruption  to  renewable  energy projects (Cronin et al. 2021).

There  are  power asymmetries between first-comers and latecomers, especially in cases where mature technologies can be located in countries with less stringent laws and standards. Carbon leakage has implications for just transitions, as carbon-intensive industries can move their dirty industries to developing countries as a way of outsourcing the production of carbon (Bos and Gupta 2019; UNU-INRA 2020, Denton et al, 2021). When the challenge of climate mitigation is transferred to developing countries in the form of carbon leakage, the risks  of carbon lock-in for developing countries are heightened  (Bos and Gupta 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id5668"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5669">Overcoming the carbon lock-in is not simply a matter of the right policies or switching to low-carbon technologies.

In short, justice is not always a shorthand for acting ethically, but rather a point of reasoning on what is considered legitimate.

Some options can help to mitigate  such  trade-offs,  like  agricultural  practices  (e.g.,  improved  yields,  agroforestry),  forest conservation (e.g. afforestation, reforestation), soil carbon sequestration (e.g. biochar addition to soils) and the removal of carbon dioxide (e.g. BECCS), which could contribute to climate change mitigation.

At the same time, climate change is projected to cause a general increase in extreme events and climate variability, placing a substantial burden on society and the economy (Hall et al. 2014). Other than the human influence on the global hydro-climate, human activities have been shown to surpass even the impact of climate change in low to moderate emission scenarios  of  the  water  balance  (Haddeland  et  al.  2014).  Similar  conclusions  have  been  found  by (Destouni et al. 2013; Koutroulis et al. 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7633"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7634">An obvious consequence of the impact of climate change on future hydro-climatic patterns is the fact that the energy system is projected to experience vast impacts through climate change  (Fricko et al. 2016; Van Vliet et al. 2016a; van Vliet et al. 2016; Chapter 6). In the short run, where fossil-fuel sources make up a significant share of the global energy grid, climate impacts related to water availability and water temperatures will affect thermoelectric power generation, which relies mainly on water cooling (Larsen and Drews 2019; Pan et al. 2018); water is also used for pollution and dust control, cleaning etc. (Larsen et al. 2019). Currently, 98% of electricity generation relies on thermoelectric power (81%) and hydropower (17%) (van Vliet et al. 2016).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7643"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7644">Of  these  thermoelectric  sources,  the  vast  majority  employ  substantial  amounts  of  water  for  cooling purposes,  although  there  is  a  trend  currently  towards  implementing  more  hybrid  or  drier  forms  of cooling (Larsen et al. 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7648"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7649">The renewable energy conversion technologies that are currently dominant globally and are projected to remain so are less vulnerable to water deficiencies than fossil-based technologies, since no cooling is used. These renewable energy conversion sources include, e.g., wind, solar PV and wave energy. The implementation of such sources will, in the longer run, have the potential to reduce water usage by the energy  sector  substantially  (Lohrmann  et  al.  2019).  Also,  an  increasing  share  of  renewables  within desalination, as well as improved irrigation efficiencies, have been shown to potentially improve the inter-sectorial WEFN water balance (Lohrmann et al. 2019). Also, an increasing share of renewables on  connection  with  desalination,  as  well  as  improved  irrigation  efficiencies,  have  been  shown  to potentially  improve  the  inter-sectorial  WEFN  water  balance  (Caldera  and  Breyer  2020).  Some  less dominant renewable-energy technologies do use water for cooling, such as geothermal energy and solar CSP, if wet cooling is employed. Despite the general detachment from water resources, wind and solar PV, for example, are highly dependent on climate-change patterns, including variability depending on future energy-storage capacities and on-/off-grid solutions (Schlott et al. 2018). Furthermore, regardless of whether or not they are based on renewables, climate change will affect energy usage across sectors, such as heating and cooling in the building stock. The energy systems in question need to be able to handle variations and extremes in demand (Larsen et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7666"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7667">For the 2080s compared to 1971-2000, an increase of 2.4% to 6.3% in the global gross hydropower potential, from the hydrological side alone, is seen across all scenarios (van Vliet et al. 2016 and Chapter 6). Alongside the global increase in hydropower potential, the global mean water-discharge cooling capacity, which also relates to water temperatures, experiences a decrease of 4.5% to 15% across the scenarios. In very general and global terms, when combined, these changes support the shift towards sources  of renewable  energy,  including hydropower,  in the energy mix.  When it comes to  ensuring stability in the management of the electricity grid, hydro-climatological extremes have the potential to pose vast difficulties in certain regions and/or seasons depending on the nature of the energy mix (Van Vliet et al. 2016b).

As the shares of thermoelectric energy production in the energy grid go down along with the introduction of  thermoelectric  cooling  technologies  using  smaller  amounts  of  water,  new  energy  sources  and technologies are being introduced, and existing sources scaled up. Of these, hydropower, wind and solar energy are the key energy sources currently and will be in the near future, making up 2.5% and 1.8% of the total global primary energy supply in 2017 respectively (IEA 2019). Wind and solar energy are directly independent of water in themselves, but are dependent on atmospheric conditions related to processes that also drive the water balance and circulation. Hydropower, on the other hand, is directly influenced by and dependent on the supply of water, while at the same time being an essential counter-component to seasonality and climatological variation, as well as to current and future demand curves and diurnal variations, as against wind and solar energy (De Barbosa et al. 2017). </span></div><div style="" id="id7898"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7899">Furthermore, policy instruments in power-system management, here exemplified by hydropower in a climate-change scenario, have been shown to enhance energy production during droughts (Gjorgiev and Sansavini 2018).

At the  same time,  the integration  of renewables  must  account  for  lower  thermoelectric  efficiencies  and  capacities  due  to  increases  in temperature (van Vliet et al. 2016), power-plant closures during extreme weather events due to a lack of cooling capacity (Forzieri et al. 2018) and further efficiency reductions and penalties following the implementation of CCS technologies in the effort to reach the GHG mitigation targets  (Byers et al. 2015).  However,  more  recent  studies  find  more  promising  amounts  of  water  being  used  for  energy conversion (IEAGHG 2020; Magneschi et al. 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7912"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7913">The  extraction,  distribution  and  wastewater  processes  of  anthropogenic  water-management  systems similarly  use  vast  amounts  of  energy,  making  the  proper  management  of  water  essential  to  reduce energy usage and GHG emissions (Nair et al. 2014 and Chapter 11). One study reports that the water sector accounts for 5% of total US GHG emissions (Rothausen and Conway 2011). Within the WEFN, there is an obvious trade-off between water availability and food production, competing demands that pose a risk to the supply of the basic commodities of food, energy and water in line with the SDGs (Bleischwitz et  al.  2018;  Gao  et al.  2019),  all  of  which  has the  potential  for inter-sectorial  or inter-</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7921">regional conflicts (Froese and Schilling 2019).

To counterbalance the demand for food and comestibles in regions that experience constant or intermittent supplies, transportation is needed, which in itself requires suitable infrastructure, energy supplies, a well-functioning trading environment and support policies. Of the 2.6 billion people who experience constant or occasional water scarcities in food production, 55% rely on international trade, 21% on domestic trade and the remainder on water stocks (Kummu et al. 2014).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7929"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7930">The  relations  between  the  influence  of  hydro-climatic  variability,  socio-economic  conditions  and patterns of water scarcity have been addressed by (Veldkamp et al. 2015).

In  East  Asia,  the  WEFN  has  been  quantified,  highlighting  obvious  trade-offs between economic growth, environmental issues and food security (White et al. 2018). This same study also highlights the concept of a virtual WEFN that includes water embodied within products that are traded and shipped.

It found that efficiency improvements, reduced resource-consumption  and  new  services  can  support  the  SDGs,  but  also  that  there  were  challenges, including in relation to equality, facing the least developed and developing countries because of their low level of access to technologies. The necessary preconditions for successful digital transformation include  prosperity,  social  inclusion,  environmental  sustainability,  protection  of  jobs  and  good governance  of  sustainability  transitions.  One  negative  impact  of  digitalisation  could  be the  rebound effects,  where  easier  access  to  services  could  increase  demand  and  with  it  GHG  emissions. Digitalization in the manufacturing sector could also provide a comparative advantage to developed countries  due  to  the  falling  importance  of  labour  costs,  while  the  barriers  to  emerging  economies seeking to enter global markets could accordingly be increased. </span></div><div style="" id="id10072"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10073">In  respect  of  governance,  Krishnan  et  al.

In its 2018 Policy and Action document, the Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren) launched Society 5.0, which include plans for smart city development (Carraz and Yuko 2019; Narvaez Rojas et al. 2021). To achieve smart cities, Society 5.0 aimed to facilitate diverse  lifestyles  and  business  success,  while  the  quality  of  life  offered  by  these  options  will  be enhanced. It also aims to offer high-standard medical and educational services. Autonomous vehicles will be available and integrated with smart grid systems in order to facilitate mobility and flexibility in energy  supply  with  a  high  share  of  renewable  energy.  The  energy  system  will  include  microgrids, renewable with demand-side controls aligned with local conditions. </span></div><div style="" id="id10095"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10096">Chapter 6 of this report on &#8220;Energy Systems&#8221; points out that there are many smart energy options with </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10098">the  potential  to  support  sustainable  development  by  facilitating  the  integration  of  high  shares  of fluctuating renewable energy in electricity systems, potentially storing energy in EV batteries or fuel cells, and applying load shifting by varying prices over time. It is concluded that very large efficiency gains are expected to emerge from digitalization in the energy sector (Figure 6.18 in Chapter 6). </span></div><div style="" id="id10103"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10104">Section  9.9.2  in  Chapter  9  concludes  that  the  improved  energy  efficiency  and  falling  costs  in  the building sector that could result from digitalization could have rebound effects in increasing both energy consumption  and  comfort  levels.  Increasing  GHG  emissions  could  be  the  result,  but  if  low-income consumers  are  given  faster  access  to  affordable  energy,  this  could  agree  with  the  SDGs,  making  it </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10109">desirable to integrate policies targeting mitigation. </span></div><div style="" id="id10111"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10112">Section  10.1.2  in  Chapter  10  discusses  how  the  sharing  economy,  which,  for  example,  could  be facilitated by ICT platforms, could influence both mitigation and the SDGs. On the one hand, sharing has  the  potential  to  save transport  emissions, especially  if  EVs  are supplied  with  decarbonised  grid electricity. However, an increase in transport emissions could result from this if increasing demand and higher comfort levels are facilitated, for example, by making access to EVs relatively easy compared with mass transit. Another possible trade-off is that the supply of public transport services would be limited to the elderly and other user groups.  </span></div><div style="" id="id10120"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10121">Green  innovation  in  agriculture  is  another  emerging  area  in  which  digitalization  is  making  huge progress. From the perspective of water provision, weather data can be used to predict rain amounts so that farmers can better manage the application of farm chemicals to minimize polluting aquifers and surface water systems used for drinking water. Meanwhile, smart meters, onsite and remote sensors and </span></div><div style="" id="id10136"/><div style="" id="id10193"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10194">satellite  data  connected  to  mobile  devices  allow  real-time  monitoring  of  crop-water  and  optimal irrigation  requirements.  On  the  supply  side,  remote  tele-control  systems  and  efficient  irrigation technologies enable farmers to control and optimize the quantity and timing of water applications, while minimizing  the  energy-consumption  trade-offs  of  pressurized  irrigation  in  both  rural  and  urban agricultural contexts (Germer et al. 2011; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2009).  </span></div><div style="" id="id10200"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10201">Technology-driven  precision  agriculture,  which  combines  geomorphology,  satellite  imagery,  global positioning  and  smart  sensors,  enables  enormous  increases  in  efficiency  and  productivity.  Taken together, these technologies provide farmers with a decision-support system in real time for the whole farm. Arguably, the world could feed the projected rise in population without radical changes to current agricultural practices if food waste can be minimized or eliminated. Digital technologies will contribute to minimizing these losses through increased efficiencies in supply chains, better shipping and transit systems, and improved refrigeration.</span></div><div style="" id="id10211"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10212">In  conclusion,  in  most  cases  digitalization  options  may  have  both  positive  synergistic  impacts  on mitigation and the SDGs and some negative trade-offs. Energy-sector options are assessed primarily as having synergies, while some digitalisation options in transport could increase the demand for emission-intensive modes of transport. Digital platforms for the sharing economy could have both positive and negative impacts depending on the goods and services that are actually exchanged (see Cross Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7). Options related to agriculture and the energy-water-food nexus could help manage </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10219">resources more efficiently across sectors, which could create synergies.

While transitions necessarily follow context-specific trajectories, more general lessons can be drawn by comparing the empirical details with </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11106">both system-level and narrower explanations of change.  </span></div><div style="" id="id11108"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11109">Sections 17.2 and 17.3 show that transitions often face multiple barriers, including infrastructure lock-in, behavioural, cultural and institutional inertia (Markard et al. 2020), trade-offs between transitions </span></div><div style="" id="id11185"/><div style="" id="id11305"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11306">and other social or political priorities (Chu 2016), cost and a reliable (and growing) supply of renewable energy  technologies  and  constituent  materials  (Garc&#237;a-Olivares  et  al.  2018).  Transitions  away  from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy-based systems, for instance, will require significant land-use decisions to avoid negative trade-offs with biodiversity and food security (Capell&#225;n-P&#233;rez et al. 2017). Previous sections underline a related need to move be</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11311">yond focusing on &#8220;rational&#8221; assessments of the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11313">costs and benefits of policies and technologies to involve people at all levels in order to overcome these multiple  barriers.  For  example,  the  case  of  coal-fired  power  in  China  (section  17.3)  shows  that  a transition to a lower carbon system is unlikely to happen even if models find it technically feasible and cost-effective.  Rather,  achieving  a  transition  requires  breaking  locked-in  high-carbon  technological trajectories,  path  dependencies  and  resistance  to  change  from  the  industries  and  actors  that  are benefiting from the current system (Rogge et al. 2017). Lock-in effects may be weaker in sectors and policy areas where fewer technologies exist, potentially opening the door to innovations that embed the climate  in  broader  sustainability  objectives  (e.g.,  technologies  and  innovations  that  support  the integration of food, water and energy goals). Such effects may still happen when there are significant information asymmetries and high-cost barriers to action, as can occur when working across multiple climate and development-related sectors (Kemp and Never 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id11325"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11326">However,  the  same  conditions  that  may  serve  to  impede  a  transition  (i.e.,  organizational  structure, behaviour, technological lock-in) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11328">can also be &#8216;flipped&#8217; to enable it</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11329"> (Burch 2010; Lee et al. 2017), while the framing of policies that are relevant to the sustainable development agenda can also create a stronger </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11332">basis and stronger policy support. The technological developments and broader cultural changes that </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11334">may  generate  new  social  demands  on  infrastructure  to  contribute  to  sustainable  development  will involve a process of social learning and awareness building (Naber et al. 2017; Sengers et al. 2019). However, it is also important to note that strong shocks to these systems, including accelerated climate-change impacts, economic crises and political changes, may provide crucial openings for accelerated transitions to sustainable systems through fundamental institutional changes (Broto et al. 2014). The global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  one  such  shock  that  has  sparked  widespread  conversations  about recovery  that  is  fundamentally  more  sustainable,  equitable  and  resilient  (McNeely  and  Munasinghe 2021). Key enabling conditions appear to be individual and collective actions, including leadership and education; financial, material, social and technical drivers that foster innovation; robust national and regional innovation systems that enhance technological diffusion (Wieczorek 2018); supportive policy and governance dynamics at multiple levels that permit both agility and coherence (see e.g. G&#246;pel et al. 2016); measures to recognize and address the challenges to equality inherent in the transition; and long-range,  holistic  planning  that  explicitly  seeks  synergies  between  climate  change  and  sustainable development while avoiding trade-offs. The sections that follow seek to assess and integrate these key categories  of  the  barriers  to  and  enablers  of  an  accelerated  transition  to  sustainable  development pathways.  </span></div><div style="" id="id11351"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11352">17.4.1</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11354">Behavioural and lifestyle changes </span></div><div style="" id="id11356"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11357">Transitions  toward  more  sustainable  development  pathways  are  both  an  individual  and  a  collective challenge, requiring an examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs  and structures that shape </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11360">behaviour, and of the dynamics of social movements and education at the local community, regional and  global  levels.

For example, in the transport sector, individuals can quickly become accustomed to personal vehicles, making it difficult for them to transition to sustainable, low-carbon modes of public transport. Demand for high-carbon transportation may also be locked in, and habits reinforced, if low-cost housing (for instance) is not sufficiently  served  by  more  sustainable  (i.e.  mass  transit,  safe  cycling  and  walking  infrastructure) transportation options (Mattioli et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id11749"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11750">This  is  made  all  the  more  challenging  because  car-</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11751">manufacturing  &#8220;incumbents&#8221;  utilize  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11752">information </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11754">campaigns directed at the public, pursue lobbying and consulting with policy-makers, and set technical standards that privilege the status quo and prevent the entry of more sustainable innovations (Smink et al. 2015; Turnheim and Nykvist 2019).

For instance,  in  Delhi,  India,  attempts  to  introduce  ostensibly  more  sustainable  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT) systems failed in part due to an arguably top-down approach that had limited public support. It may nonetheless be difficult to win public support (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018), and even grassroots initiatives may themselves be contested and dynamic, making it difficult to generate the collective push to drive a bottom-up transition forward (Hakansson 2018).  </span></div><div style="" id="id11769"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11770">However, dominant, top-down approaches and local, grassroots "alternative" approaches and values do overlap and interact.

The  exclusion  of  proper  rents  for  scarcities  or  for  global  and  local externalities, including climate change, can undermine larger-scale changes to energy systems (Clark et al. 2018).

The EU's previous actions regarding the "shareholder maximisation norm" and non-binding measures have created path dependencies, limiting  its flexibility in creating sustainable financial legislation.

Studies of developing megacities, for instance, have found the lack of mechanisms promoting vertical cross-level integration to be a sizable constraint on decarbonisation (Canitez 2019).

As such, many of the claims reviewed involve not only increasing the  speed  of  the  transition  but  also  ensuring  that  it  is  just,  equitable  and  delivers  a  wider  range  of environmental and social benefits. A sustainability transition requires removing the underlying drivers of  vulnerability  and  high  emissions  (quality  and  depth)  while  aligning  the  interests  of  different communities, regions, sectors, stakeholders and cultures (scale and breadth).  </span></div><div style="" id="id12903"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12904">Interest in a sustainability transition has grown steadily over the history of the IPCC and of climate and related policy processes. That interest hit a high point in 2015 with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs. It has continued to remain high as countries have issued NDCs on climate change, VNRs on the SDGs and, in some instances, integrated climate and SDG plans (or similarly themed integrated actions, e.g. circular economy plans). Interest has also gained momentum as local governments, businesses and other stakeholders have followed suit with climate change- or SDG-related plans.  </span></div><div style="" id="id12912"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12913">Implementing many of the recent pledges, however, has proved challenging. Part of the challenge is a need to address everything from public policies and prevailing technologies to individual lifestyles and social  norms  to  governance  arrangements  and  institutions  with  associated  political  economy </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12917">implications. These factors can lock in development pathways and prevent transitions from gathering the  momentum  needed  for  large-scale  transformations  of  socioeconomic  systems.  Another consideration is that transition pathways are likely to vary across and within countries due to different development levels, starting points, differential vulnerabilities, capacities, agencies, geographies, power dynamics, political economies, ecosystems and other contextual factors.  </span></div><div style="" id="id12923"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12924">Even with this diversity, prominent lines of economic, institutional, psychological and systems thinking have reflected  on  interventions  that can  enable  transitions.  Because  these  disciplines  often  focus  on different  levels  of  analysis  and  draw  upon  diverse  analytical  methods  and  empirical  evidence,  the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12928">recommended interventions also tend to vary. For instance, economic arguments often point to the need for targeted regulation or investments, institutional claims centre on multilevel governance reforms, and psychology encourages participation to change mind sets and social norms. Systems-level perspectives offer a useful frame for bringing together these views, but may not capture the richness and details of </span></div><div style="" id="id13006"/><div style="" id="id13127"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13128">them treated separately. Greater inter- and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the more focused interventions and show how they work together in a system. Such research will be particularly important for working on the concern running through these studies: strengthening synergies between climate and the broader sustainable development agenda.  </span></div><div style="" id="id13133"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13134">National  and  sub-national,  sectoral  and  cross-sectoral,  short-  and  long-term  transition  studies  have assessed the links between sustainable development and mitigation policies and synergies and the trade-offs between the different policy domains. Some general conclusions can be drawn on synergies and trade-offs,  despite  the  actual  impacts  of  policy  implementation  depending  on scale,  context  and  the development starting point.  </span></div><div style="" id="id13140"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13141">From a cross-sectoral perspective, it can be concluded that the AFOLU sector offers many low-cost mitigation options with synergetic SDG impacts, which, however, can also create trade-offs between land-use for food, energy, forest and biodiversity. Some options can help to mitigate such trade-offs, like  agricultural  practices,  forest  conservation  and  soil  carbon  sequestration.  Lifestyle  changes, including  dietary  changes  and  reduced  food  waste,  could  jointly  support  the  SDGs  and  mitigation. Industry  also  offers  several  mitigation  options  with  SDG  synergies,  for  example,  related  to  energy efficiency and the circular economy. Some of the renewable-energy options in industry could indicate some trade-offs in relation to land use, with implications for food- and water security and costs. Cities provide  a  promising  basis  for  implementing  mitigation  with  SDG  synergies,  particularly  if  urban </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13151">planning, transportation, infrastructure and settlements are coordinated jointly. Similarly, studies of the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13153">building sector have identified many synergies between the SDGs and mitigation, but there are issues related to the costs of new technologies. Also, in relation to households and buildings, important equity issues emerge due to the ability of low-income groups to afford the introduction of new technologies. Altogether  these cross-sectoral conclusions  create  a  need  for  policies  to  address  both  synergies and trade-offs, as well as for coordination between different sectoral domains. Context-specific assessments of  synergies  and  trade-offs  are  here  important,  as  is  sharing  the  benefits  and  costs  associated  with mitigation policies.  </span></div><div style="" id="id13161"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13162">Several opportunities for creating SDG synergies and avoiding trade-offs have also been identified in relation to integrated adaptation and mitigation policies. The AFOLU sector has a large potential for integrating adaptation and mitigation policies related to agriculture, bioenergy crops, forestry and water use. As was concluded for mitigation options, integrated adaptation and mitigation policies also entail the  risks  of  creating  trade-offs  in  relation  to  food,  water,  energy  access  and  biodiversity.  There  are several  potentially  strong  links  between  climate-change  adaptation  in  industry  and  climate-change adaptation more generally. Various supply chains can be affected by climate change, and mitigation options  related  to  energy  and  water  supply  can  be  disrupted  by  climate  events,  implying  that  great benefits  may  come  from  integrating  adaptation  in  industrial  planning  efforts.  Adaptation  options  in industry can imply increasing the demand for packaging materials such as plastics and for access to refrigeration,  which  are  also  major  sources  of  GHG  emissions,  which  then  would  require  further mitigation options. Mitigation and the co-benefits of adaptation in urban areas in relation to air quality, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13175">health, green jobs and equality issues can in most cases to be synergetic and can also support the SDGs. One  exception  are  compact  cities,  with  their  trade-offs  between  mitigation  and  adaptation  because decreasing  urban  sprawl  can  increase  the  risks  of  flooding  and  heat  stress.  Detailed  mapping  of mitigation and adaptation in urban areas shows that there are many, very close interactions between the two policy domains and that coordinated governance across sectors is therefore called for. </span></div><div style="" id="id13181"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13182">Meeting the ambitions of the Paris Agreement will require phasing out fossil fuels from energy systems, which is technically possible and is estimated to be relatively low in cost. However, studies also show that  replacing  fossil  fuels  with  renewables  can  have  major  synergies  and  trade-offs  with  a  broader agenda of sustainable development if a balance is established in relation to land use, food security and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13187">job creation (McCollum et al. 2018). Furthermore, the transition to low-emission pathways will require policy  efforts  that  also  address  the  emissions  locked  into  existing  infrastructure,  like  power  plants, factories, cargo ships and other infrastructure already in use: for example, today coal-fired power plants account for 30% of all energy-related emissions. Thus, even though the transition away from fossil fuels </span></div><div style="" id="id13202"/><div style="" id="id13318"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13319">is  desirable  and  technically  feasible,  it  is  still  largely  constrained  by  existing  fossil  fuel-based infrastructure  and  the  existence  of  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13321">stranded  investments.  The  &#8220;committed&#8221;  emissions  from  existing </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13323">fossil-fuel infrastructure may consume all the remaining carbon budget  in the 1.5&#176;C scenario or two thirds of the carbon budget in the 2&#176;C scenario. </span></div><div style="" id="id13326"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13327">Stranded hydrocarbon assets, including hydrocarbon resources and the infrastructure from which they are  produced,  and  investments  made  in  exploration  and  production  activities,  are  likely  to  become unusable, lose value, or may end up as liabilities before the end of the anticipated economic lifetime. This phenomenon is rapidly becoming a global reality as social norms change and the pressure to reduce emissions  mounts.  Energy  and  other  forms  of  structural  inequities  are  likely  to  make  the  transition planning more challenging, especially given stranded assets.  </span></div><div style="" id="id13334"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13335">Countries dependent on fossil fuel income will need to forego these revenues to keep well within the Paris  agreement  requirements  and  align  with  the  rapidly  growing  divestment  movement.  Climate injustice, energy poverty, and COVID 19 have reduced the space and maneuverability for developing countries to innovate and use surplus funds to procure new and clean technologies. A rising debt burden already hamstrings many.  Decisions on how to spend the remaining carbon budget and who has the right to decide on what to do with existing fossil fuels reflect the complexity of the transition and its non-linearity character. Given the asymmetrical dimension of energy production, distribution, and use, it is likely that stranded assets will have implications for oil-producing countries, especially for early </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13344">producers who perceive that newfound oil and gas will open doors to new forms of prosperity. </span></div><div style="" id="id13346"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13347">While  the  transitional  drivers  are  not  in  place  in  some  developing  countries,  i.e.,  technology, infrastructure, knowledge, and finance, among others, investing in new forms of renewable energy for land,  energy,  or  water  sectors  will  see  the  emergence  of  a  more  diversified  economy  and  one  less vulnerable to carbon and other exogenous risks.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13352">The transition away from fossil fuels will come with hard  choices.

Viewing climate change through the lens of justice requires a focus on the protection of vulnerable populations from the impacts of climate change, addressing the unequal distribution of the costs and consequences of the transitions themselves, including for those whose livelihoods are rooted in fossil fuel-based  sectors,  and  developing  more  creative  and  participatory  processes  for  envisioning  an equitable decarbonized world. Neglecting issues of justice will have implications for the pace, scale and quality of the transition. </span></div><div style="" id="id13366"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13367">Ultimately, the evidence demonstrates that there is rarely any one single factor promoting or preventing transitions. A constellation of elements come into play, including technological innovations, shifts in markets, social and behavioural dynamics, and governance arrangements. Indeed, transitions require an </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13371">examination of the role of values, attitudes, beliefs and the structures that shape behaviour, as well as the dynamics of social movements and education at multiple levels. Likewise, technological and social innovation both play an important role in enabling transitions, highlighting the importance of multi-institutional  and  multi-stakeholder  actors  building  institutional  support  networks,  facilitating collaboration between sectors and actors, and promoting learning and social change. Financial tools and economic  instruments  are  crucial  enablers,  since  many  forms  of  transformational  change  to  energy systems  are  not  possible  when  financial  systems  still  privilege  investing  in  unsustainable,  carbon-intensive sectors. These instruments are deployed within the context of the multi-level governance of climate  change,  which  suggests  the  importance  of  complementary  policies  and  institutions  that simultaneously integrate across multiple sectors and scales to address the multiple sources of lock-in </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13382">that  are  shaping  the  current  carbon-intensive  energy  system.
