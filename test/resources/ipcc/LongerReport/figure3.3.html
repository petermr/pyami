The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). &#8220;No-to-moderate  response&#8221;  describes  efforts  as  of  today  (i.e.,  no  further  significant  action  or  new  types  of  actions). &#8220;Maximum potential response&#8221; represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), coastal hazards (flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defences, ecosystem restoration  or  creation  of  new  natural  buffers  areas,  and  subsidence  management)  and  planned  relocation.  Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be considered to be adaptation. </span><span id="id5289" class="s1046">Panel (d)</span><span id="id5290" class="s1045">: </span><span id="id5291" class="s1046">Left</span><span id="id5292" class="s1045"> - Heat-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness.
