RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health,  livelihoods,  assets  and  ecosystems  from  extreme  weather  events  such  as  heatwaves,  heavy  rain,  drought  and  associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to  uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio- ecological  systems  that  can  be  aggregated globally  into  a  single  metric,  such  as  monetary  damages,  lives  affected,  species  lost  or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet instability or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods include a structured expert elicitation based on the literature described in WGII SM16.6 and are identical to AR5 but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6.

When  CO2  is  captured  directly  from  the  atmosphere  (DACCS),  or  from  biomass  (BECCS),  CCS  provides  the  storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production,  where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which  is  more  than  the  CO2  storage  requirements  through  2100  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5&#176;C,  although  the  regional  availability  of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the  CO2  can  be  permanently  isolated  from  the  atmosphere.  Implementation  of  CCS  currently  faces  technological,  economic, institutional, ecological environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C to 2&#176;C. Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers.

Mexico is considered part of Latin America and the Caribbean for WGIII. {WGII 12.1.1, WGIII AII.1.1} </span><span id="id7430" class="s1046">Subject to Copy Edit                                                                                                                                                                         </span><span id="id7431" class="s1045">p.57 </span></li><li><span id="id7806" class="s1010">91</span><span id="id7807" class="s1045"> In this context, &#8216;unabated fossil fuels&#8217; refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted throughout the life cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO</span></li><li><span id="id8028" class="s1010">92</span><span id="id8029" class="s1045"> See Annex I: Glossary.
