Global assessments focus on  large  studies, multi-species,  meta-analyses  and  large  reviews.  Regional  assessments  consider  evidence  on  impacts across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is assessed and both adverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and methodology see WGII SMTS.1).  Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect  the  assessment  of  attribution  of  the  observed  impact  to  climate  change.  {WGI  Figure  SPM.3,  Table  TS.5, Interactive Atlas; WGII Figure SPM.2, WGII SMTS.1, WGII 8.3.1, Figure 8.5; WGIII 2.2.3} </span><div style="top: 12803px;" id="id1809" class="s1"><span id="id1810" class="s0">[END FIGURE 2.3 HERE] </span></div></div></body></html>
