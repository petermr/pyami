Solid  blue  lines indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. Yellow shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding to USD55&#8211;148 per MWh). In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the three renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts. Further, LCOE  does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment. The </span><span id="id2599" class="s1046">bottom panel (b)</span><span id="id2600" class="s1045"> shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change over the past decade.

Renewable energy and battery technologies were selected as illustrative examples  because  they  have  recently  shown  rapid  changes  in  costs  and  adoption,  and  because  consistent  data  are available.  Other  mitigation  options  assessed  in  the  WGIII  report  are  not  included  as  they  do  not  meet  these  criteria. {WGIII Figure SPM.3} </span><div style="top: 18006px;" id="id2645" class="s1"><span id="id2646" class="s1046">[END FIGURE 2.4 HERE]</span></div></div></body></html>
