When  CO2  is  captured  directly  from  the  atmosphere  (DACCS),  or  from  biomass  (BECCS),  CCS  provides  the  storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production,  where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which  is  more  than  the  CO2  storage  requirements  through  2100  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5&#176;C,  although  the  regional  availability  of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the  CO2  can  be  permanently  isolated  from  the  atmosphere.  Implementation  of  CCS  currently  faces  technological,  economic, institutional, ecological environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C to 2&#176;C.

Diverse knowledges and values include cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge.

There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5&#176;C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic development impact GHG emissions and hence shape mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for action  are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed, dashed pathway), and enabling and constraining conditions (left panel), and take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps.

Panel (a)</span><span id="id8861" class="s1045"> presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different systems. The left hand side of panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5&#176;C global warming. As literature above 1.5&#176;C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The  term  response  is  used  here  in  addition  to  adaptation  because  some  responses,  such  as  migration,  relocation  and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, allows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation and afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions  (economic,  technological,  institutional,  social, environmental  and  geophysical)  were used  to  calculate  the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and low. The right hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs are net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net GHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are  the  sum  of  reduced  emissions  and/or  enhanced  sinks. The  baseline used  consists  of  current  policy  (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25/75 percentile values). The mitigation potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length of the solid bars represents the mitigation  potential  of  an  option.  Potentials  are  broken  down  into  cost  categories,  indicated  by  different  colours (see legend).  Only  discounted  lifetime  monetary  costs  are  considered.  Where  a  gradual  colour  transition  is  shown,  the  breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such as geographical  location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25&#8211;50%. When interpreting this figure, the following should be taken into account: (1) The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) being displaced, the rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the cost aspects, which are not reflected in the figure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included. </span></div><div style="top: 62015px;" id="id8894" class="s1"><span id="id8895" class="s1046">Panel (b) </span><span id="id8896" class="s1045">displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food  shows  demand-side  potential  of  socio-cultural  factors  and  infrastructure  use,  and  changes  in  land-use  patterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40&#8211;70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up  assessment,  this  projected  increase  in  electricity  demand  can  be  avoided  through  demand-side  mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow). </span></div><div style="top: 62188px;" id="id8911" class="s1"><span id="id8912" class="s1045">{WGII SPM Figure SPM 4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.10, WGIII Chapter 12.2.1, WGIII Chapter 12.2.2, WGIII Figure SPM 6, WGIII SPM Figure SPM 7} </span></div><div style="top: 62222px;" id="id8915" class="s1"><span id="id8916" class="s1046">[END FIGURE 4.4 HERE] </span></div><div style="top: 62259px;" id="id8918" class="s1"><span id="id8919" class="s1007">4.5.1 Energy Systems </span></div><div style="top: 62284px;" id="id8923" class="s1"><span id="id8924" class="s0">Rapid  and  deep  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  require  major  energy  system  transitions  (</span><span id="id8925" class="s1007">high confidence</span><span id="id8927" class="s0">).
