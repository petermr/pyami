## Summary for a student in high school

* Urbanization is a worldwide trend that is frequently linked to better earnings and higher consumption, but the rising concentration of people and activities offers a chance to improve resource efficiency and decarbonize at scale.
* In developing nations, where per capita emissions are now low but are anticipated to rise due to the development and use of new infrastructure and the built environment, as well as changes in income and lifestyle, the majority of future urban population expansion will take place.
* The urban portion of global GHG emissions, including CO2 and CH4, is significant and growing.
* Between 2000 and 2015, the urban portion of regional GHG emissions grew, with significant regional heterogeneity in the increase's size.
* Cities in the Developed Countries area produced roughly seven times more per capita than the lowest emitting region between 2000 and 2015, with per capita urban GHG emissions increasing over that time.
* Due to population growth trends, urban land expansion, infrastructure demand, and timing of urban mitigation action, the global share of future urban GHG emissions is predicted to increase through 2050 with little to no mitigation efforts. However, the extent of the increase depends on the scenario and the scope and timing of urban mitigation action.
* Between 2015 and 2050, the amount of urban land might treble, with substantial consequences for the future carbon lock-in.
* Upgrading and building new urban infrastructure will generate a large amount of emissions until 2030.
* There is an urgent need to incorporate urban mitigation and adaptation methods for cities to combat climate change and survive its consequences given the dual difficulties of increased urban GHG emissions and future estimates of more frequent extreme climatic events.
* The only way for cities to attain net zero or nearly net zero GHG emissions is through systemic change and thorough decarbonization.
* Multiple urban-scale interventions can have cascading effects across sectors, reduce GHG emissions outside of a city's administrative boundaries, and reduce more emissions than the net sum of individual interventions in packages of mitigation policies that are implemented, especially if multiple scales of governance are included.
* It will be necessary to involve many levels of governance, such as governments and non-state actors, as well as substantial finance that goes beyond sectoral methods, in order to achieve transformative changes in cities for climate change mitigation and adaptation.
