Urban  areas  also  account  for  a  growing  proportion  of  national  and  global emissions depending on emissions scope and geographic boundary. These trends are projected to grow in the coming decades; in 2100, some scenarios show the urban share of global emissions above 80%, with  63%  being  at  the  minimum  for  any  scenario  (with  the  shares  being  in  different  contexts  of emissions reduction or increase) (Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4). As such, urban climate change mitigation considers the majority of the world&#8217;s population, as well some of the key drivers of global emissions. In general, emissions scenarios with limited outward urban land expansion are also associated with a smaller rise in global temperature (Section 8.3.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id17955"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17956">The urban share of global emissions and its projected growth stem in part from urban carbon lock-in&#8212;that  is,  the  path  dependency  and  inertia  of  committed  emissions  through  the  long  lifespan  of  urban </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17959">layout,  infrastructures,  and  behaviour.  As  such,  urban  mitigation  efforts  that  address  lock-in  can significantly reduce emissions (Section 8.4.1). Electrification of urban energy systems in tandem with implementing  multiple  urban-scale  mitigation  strategies,  could  reduce  urban  emissions  by  90%  by 2050--thereby significantly reducing global emissions (Section 8.3.4). Urban areas can also act as points of intervention to amplify synergies and co-benefits for accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals (Section 8.2). </span></div><div style="" id="id18052"/><div style="" id="id18092"><a name="99" id="id18093">Page 99</a></div>

Integrating these mitigation strategies across sectors, geographic scales, and levels of governance will yield the greatest emissions savings (Sections 8.4 and 8.5). </span></div><div style="" id="id18158"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18159">A  city&#8217;s  layout,  patterns,  and  spatial  arrangements  of  land  use,  transportation  systems,  and  built environment (urban form), as well as its state and form(s) of development (urban growth typology), can inform the most impactful emissions savings &#8216;entry point&#8217; and priorities for urban mitigation strategies (Sections  8.4.2  and  8.6). For  rapidly  growing and emerging  urban  areas,  there is  the  opportunity  to avoid carbon lock-in by focusing on urban form that promotes low-carbon infrastructure and enables low-impact  behaviour  facilitated  by  co-located  medium  to  high  densities  of  jobs  and  housing, walkability,  and  transit-oriented  development  (Sections  8.6.2  and  8.6.3).  For  established  cities, strategies include electrification of the grid and transport, and implementing energy efficiency across sectors (Section 8.6.1). </span></div><div style="" id="id18169"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18170">FAQ 8.3 How do we estimate global emissions from cities, and how reliable are the estimates? </span></div><div style="" id="id18172"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18173">There are two different emissions estimation techniques applied, individually or in combination, to the four frameworks outlined in Section 8.1.6.2 to estimate urban GHG emissions: &#8216;top-down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom-up.&#8217;  The  top-down  technique  uses  atmospheric  GHG  concentrations  and  atmospheric  modelling  to estimate direct (scope 1) emissions (see Glossary). The bottom-up technique estimates emissions using local activity data or direct measurements such as in smokestacks, traffic data, energy consumption information,  and  building  use.  Bottom-up  techniques  will  often  include  'indirect  emissions  (see Glossary)  from  purchased  electricity  (scope  2)  and  the  urban  supply  chain  (scope  3).  Inclusion  of supply-chain  emissions  often  requires  additional  data  such  as  consumer  purchasing  data  and supply chain emission factors. Some researchers also take a hybrid approach combining top-down and bottom-up  estimation techniques to  quantify territorial emissions.  Individual  self-reported  urban inventories from  cities  have  shown  chronic  underestimation  when  compared  to  estimates  using  combined  top-down/bottom-up atmospherically calibrated estimation techniques. </span></div><div style="" id="id18186"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18187">No approach has been systematically applied to all cities worldwide. Rather, they have been applied individually  or  in  combination  to  subsets  of  global  cities.  Considerable  uncertainty  remains  in estimating urban emissions. However, top-down approaches have somewhat more objective techniques for  uncertainty  estimation  in  comparison  to  bottom-up  approaches.  Furthermore,  supply  chain estimation typically has more uncertainty than direct or territorial emission frameworks.</span></div><div style="" id="id18203"/><div style="" id="id18241"><a name="100" id="id18242">Page 100</a></div>
