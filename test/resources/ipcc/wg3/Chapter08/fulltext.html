Urban  areas  also  account  for  a  growing  proportion  of  national  and  global emissions depending on emissions scope and geographic boundary. These trends are projected to grow in the coming decades; in 2100, some scenarios show the urban share of global emissions above 80%, with  63%  being  at  the  minimum  for  any  scenario  (with  the  shares  being  in  different  contexts  of emissions reduction or increase) (Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4). As such, urban climate change mitigation considers the majority of the world&#8217;s population, as well some of the key drivers of global emissions. In general, emissions scenarios with limited outward urban land expansion are also associated with a smaller rise in global temperature (Section 8.3.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id17955"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17956">The urban share of global emissions and its projected growth stem in part from urban carbon lock-in&#8212;that  is,  the  path  dependency  and  inertia  of  committed  emissions  through  the  long  lifespan  of  urban </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17959">layout,  infrastructures,  and  behaviour.  As  such,  urban  mitigation  efforts  that  address  lock-in  can significantly reduce emissions (Section 8.4.1). Electrification of urban energy systems in tandem with implementing  multiple  urban-scale  mitigation  strategies,  could  reduce  urban  emissions  by  90%  by 2050--thereby significantly reducing global emissions (Section 8.3.4). Urban areas can also act as points of intervention to amplify synergies and co-benefits for accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals (Section 8.2). </span></div><div style="" id="id18052"/><div style="" id="id18092"><a name="99" id="id18093">Page 99</a></div>

Integrating these mitigation strategies across sectors, geographic scales, and levels of governance will yield the greatest emissions savings (Sections 8.4 and 8.5). </span></div><div style="" id="id18158"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18159">A  city&#8217;s  layout,  patterns,  and  spatial  arrangements  of  land  use,  transportation  systems,  and  built environment (urban form), as well as its state and form(s) of development (urban growth typology), can inform the most impactful emissions savings &#8216;entry point&#8217; and priorities for urban mitigation strategies (Sections  8.4.2  and  8.6). For  rapidly  growing and emerging  urban  areas,  there is  the  opportunity  to avoid carbon lock-in by focusing on urban form that promotes low-carbon infrastructure and enables low-impact  behaviour  facilitated  by  co-located  medium  to  high  densities  of  jobs  and  housing, walkability,  and  transit-oriented  development  (Sections  8.6.2  and  8.6.3).  For  established  cities, strategies include electrification of the grid and transport, and implementing energy efficiency across sectors (Section 8.6.1). </span></div><div style="" id="id18169"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18170">FAQ 8.3 How do we estimate global emissions from cities, and how reliable are the estimates? </span></div><div style="" id="id18172"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18173">There are two different emissions estimation techniques applied, individually or in combination, to the four frameworks outlined in Section 8.1.6.2 to estimate urban GHG emissions: &#8216;top-down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom-up.&#8217;  The  top-down  technique  uses  atmospheric  GHG  concentrations  and  atmospheric  modelling  to estimate direct (scope 1) emissions (see Glossary). The bottom-up technique estimates emissions using local activity data or direct measurements such as in smokestacks, traffic data, energy consumption information,  and  building  use.  Bottom-up  techniques  will  often  include  'indirect  emissions  (see Glossary)  from  purchased  electricity  (scope  2)  and  the  urban  supply  chain  (scope  3).  Inclusion  of supply-chain  emissions  often  requires  additional  data  such  as  consumer  purchasing  data  and supply chain emission factors. Some researchers also take a hybrid approach combining top-down and bottom-up  estimation techniques to  quantify territorial emissions.  Individual  self-reported  urban inventories from  cities  have  shown  chronic  underestimation  when  compared  to  estimates  using  combined  top-down/bottom-up atmospherically calibrated estimation techniques. </span></div><div style="" id="id18186"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18187">No approach has been systematically applied to all cities worldwide. Rather, they have been applied individually  or  in  combination  to  subsets  of  global  cities.  Considerable  uncertainty  remains  in estimating urban emissions. However, top-down approaches have somewhat more objective techniques for  uncertainty  estimation  in  comparison  to  bottom-up  approaches.  Furthermore,  supply  chain estimation typically has more uncertainty than direct or territorial emission frameworks.</span></div><div style="" id="id18203"/><div class="tree_root"><div style="" id="id162" marker="Chapter 8:"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 15px;" id="id163">Chapter 8:</span><div style="" id="id166"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 15px;" id="id167">Urban Systems and Other Settlements </span></div><div style="" id="id169"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id170">Coordinating Lead Authors</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id171">: Shuaib Lwasa (Uganda), Karen C.

The starting point  for  that  chapter  was how  the  spatial  organization  of  urban  settlements  affects  greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions and how urban form and infrastructure could facilitate mitigation of climate change. A main finding in AR5 was that urban form shapes urban energy consumption and GHG emissions.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1638"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1639">Since AR5, there has been growing scientific literature and policy foci on urban strategies for climate change mitigation. There are three possible reasons for this. First, according to AR5 Working Group III (WGIII) Chapter 12 on Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Spatial Planning, urban areas generate between 71&#8211;76% of carbon dioxide (CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id1643">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1644">) emissions from global final energy use and between 67&#8211;76% of global energy (Seto et al. 2014). Thus, focusing on &#8216;urban systems&#8217; (see Glossary and Figure 8.15) addresses one of the key drivers of emissions. Second, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas, and by mid-century 7 out of 10 people on the planet will live in a town or a city (UN DESA 2019). Thus, coming up with mitigation strategies that are relevant to urban settlements is critical for </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1650">successful mitigation of climate change. Third, beyond climate change, there is growing attention on </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1652">cities as major catalysts of change and to help achieve the objectives outlined in multiple international frameworks and assessments. </span></div><div style="" id="id1655"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1656">Cities  are  also  gaining  traction  within  the  work  of  the  IPCC.  The  IPCC  Special  Report  on  Global Warming  of  1.5&#176;C  (SR1.5  Chapter  4)  identified  four  systems  that  urgently  need  to  change  in fundamental  and  transformative  ways:  urban  infrastructure,  land  use  and  ecosystems,  industry,  and energy. Urban infrastructure was singled out but urban systems form a pivotal part of the other three systems requiring change (IPCC 2018a) (see &#8216;infrastructure&#8217; in Glossary). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) identified cities not only as spatial units for land-based mitigation options  but  also  places for  managing demand for natural resources including food,  fibre, and  water (IPCC 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1665"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1666">Other  international  frameworks  are  highlighting  the  importance  of  cities.  For  example,  the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on nature&#8217;s contribution  to  people  is  clear:  cities  straddle  the  biodiversity  sphere in  the sense that they present spatial units of ecosystem fragmentation and degradation while at the same time contain spatial units  where  the  concentration  of  biodiversity  compares  favourably  with  some  landscapes  (IPBES 2019a).  Cities  are  also  featured  as  a  key  element  in  the  transformational  governance  to  tackle  both climate change and biodiversity and ecosystem challenges in the first-ever IPCC-IPBES co-sponsored workshop report (P&#246;rtner et al. 2021) (see Section 8.5 and &#8216;governance&#8217; in Glossary). </span></div><div style="" id="id1675"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1676">The  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  further  underscore  the  importance  of  cities  in  the international arena with the inclusion of SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities for &#8216;inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable&#8217; cities and human settlements (United Nations 2015; Queiroz et al. 2017; United  Nations  2019).  Additionally,  UN-Habitat&#8217;s  New  Urban  Agenda  (NUA)  calls  for  various measures,  including  integrated  spatial  planning  at  the  city-regional  scale,  to  address  the  systemic challenges  included  in  greening  cities,  among  which  is  emissions  reduction  and  avoidance  (United Nations 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id1700"/><div style="" id="id1740"><a name="10" id="id1741">Page 10</a></div>

In particular, the nexus approach, such as the water and energy nexus and the water-energy-food nexus, is increasingly being used to understand potential emissions and energy savings from cross-sectoral linkages that occur in cities (Wang and Chen 2016; Engstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Valek et al. 2017). There is also a growing literature that aims to quantify transboundary urban GHG emissions and carbon footprint beyond urban and national administrative boundaries (Chen et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2016).

By &#8216;urban system&#8217; (see Figure 8.15), this chapter refers to two related concepts. First, an urban systems approach recognizes that cities do not function in isolation. Rather, cities exhibit strong interdependencies across scales, whether it is within a region, a country, a continent, or worldwide. Cities are embedded in broader ecological, economic, technical, institutional, legal, and governance structures that often constrain their systemic function, which cannot be separated from wider power relations (Bai et al. 2016). </span></div><div style="" id="id2069"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2070">The notion of a system of cities has been around for nearly 100 years and recognizes that cities are interdependent,  in  that  significant  changes  in  one  city,  such  as  economic  activities,  income,  or population, will affect other cities in the system (Christaller 1933; Berry 1964; Marshall 1989). This perspective of an urban system emphasizes the connections between a city and other cities, as well as between a city and its hinterlands (Hall and Hay 1980; Ramaswami et al. 2017b; Xu et al. 2018c). An important point is that growth in one city affects growth in other cities in the global, national or regional system of cities (Gabaix 1999; Scholvin et al. 2019; Knoll 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id2078"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2079">Moreover, there is a hierarchy of cities (Taylor 1997; Liu et al. 2014), with very large cities at the top of the hierarchy concentrating political power and financial resources, but of which there are very few. Rather, the urban system is dominated by small- and medium-sized cities and towns. With globalization and increased interconnectedness of financial flows, labour, and supply chains, cities across the world today  have  long-distance  relationships  on  multiple  dimensions  but  are  also  connected  to  their </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2085">hinterlands for resources. </span></div><div style="" id="id2087"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2088">The second key component of the urban systems lens identifies the activities and sectors within a city as  being  inter-connected&#8212;that  cities  are  ecosystems  (Rees  1997;  Grimm  et  al.  2000;  Newman  and Jennings 2008; Acuto et al. 2019; Abdullah and Garcia-Chueca 2020; Acuto and Leffel 2021). This urban  systems  perspective  emphasizes  linkages  and  interrelations  within  cities.  The  most  evident example of this is urban form and infrastructure, which refer to the patterns and spatial arrangements of land  use,  transportation  systems,  and  urban  design.  Changes  in  urban  form  and  infrastructure  can simultaneously affect multiple sectors, such as buildings, energy, and transport. </span></div><div style="" id="id2103"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2104">Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute </span></div><div style="" id="id2106"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2107">8-10  </span></div><div style="" id="id2109"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2110">Total pages: 157</span></div><div style="" id="id2116"/><div style="" id="id2156"><a name="12" id="id2157">Page 12</a></div>

This chapter assesses urban systems, which includes cities and towns. It uses a similar framework as Chapter 6 of AR6 IPCC WGII, referring to cities and urban settlements as &#8216;concentrated human habitation centres that exist along a continuum&#8217; (Dodman et al. 2022) (for further definitions of &#8216;urban,&#8217; &#8216;cities,&#8217; &#8216;settlements,&#8217; and related terms, see Glossary, and WGII Chapter 6). </span></div><div style="" id="id2185"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2186">8.1.4</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id2188">The urban century </span></div><div style="" id="id2190"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2191">The 21st century will be the urban century, defined by a massive increase in global urban populations and  a  significant  building  up  of  new  urban  infrastructure  stock  to  accommodate  the  growing  urban population.

While these capacities differ across  contexts  (Hickmann  et  al.  2017),  several  governance  challenges  are  similar  across  cities (Gouldson  et  al.  2015).

In some cases, these private interests are tied up with international flows of capital. In India, adaptation plans involving networks  of  private  actors  and  related  mitigation  actions  have  resulted  in  the  dominance  of  private interests. This has led to trade-offs and adverse impacts on the poor (Chu 2016; Mehta et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id2775"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2776">When planning and implementing low-carbon transitions, it is important to consider the socio-economic context. An inclusive approach emphasizes the need to engage non-state actors, including businesses, research organizations, non-profit organizations and citizens (Lee and Painter 2015; Hale et al. 2020). For example, engaging people in defining locally relevant mitigation targets and actions has enabled successful transformations in China (Engels 2018), Africa (G&#246;pfert et al. 2019) and Malaysia (Ho et al. 2015). An active research and government collaboration through multiple stakeholder interactions in a large  economic  corridor  in  Malaysia  led  to  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  low-carbon blueprint for the region  (Ho et al. 2013).

Quantitative understanding of these transfers and the resulting emissions and uptake with an urban area is essential for accurate urban carbon accounting (USGCRP 2018). Currently, urban areas are a net source of carbon because they emit more carbon than they uptake. Thus, urban mitigation strategies require a twofold strategy: reducing urban emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, and enhancing uptake of carbon in urban  pools  (Churkina  2012)  (for  a  broader  definition  of  &#8216;carbon  cycle&#8217;  and  related  terms  such  as &#8216;carbon sink,&#8217; carbon stock,&#8217; &#8216;carbon neutrality,&#8217; &#8216;GHG neutrality,&#8217; and others, see Glossary). </span></div><div style="" id="id3016"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3017">Burning fossil fuels to generate energy for buildings, transportation, industry, and other sectors is a major  source  of  urban  GHG  emissions  (Gurney  et  al.  2015).  At  the  same  time,  most  cities  do  not generate  within  their  boundaries  all  of the  resources they  use,  such  as  electricity,  gasoline,  cement, water,  and  food  needed  for  local  homes  and  businesses  to  function  (Jacobs  1969),  requiring consideration  of  GHG  emissions  embodied  in  supply  chains  serving  cities.  Furthermore,  urban vegetation, soils, and aquatic systems can both emit or remove carbon from the urban atmosphere and are often heavily managed. For example, urban parks, forests, and street trees actively remove carbon from the atmosphere through growing season photosynthesis. They can become a net source of carbon most often during the dormant season or heat waves. Some of the sequestered carbon can be stored in the biomass of urban trees, soils, and aquatic systems. Urban infrastructures containing cement also uptake carbon through the process of carbonation. The uptake of carbon by urban trees is at least two orders  of  magnitude  faster  than  by  cement-containing  infrastructures  (Churkina  2012)  (see  Section 8.4.4, and Figures 8.17 and 8.18). </span></div><div style="" id="id3031"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3032">8.1.6.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3034">Urban emissions accounting </span></div><div style="" id="id3036"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3037">Urban GHG emissions accounting can determine critical conceptual and quantitative aspects of urban GHG  emissions.

These frameworks all aim to quantify urban GHG emissions but reflect different perspectives on where the emission responsibility is allocated in addition to how much and which components of the GHG emissions associated with the import and export of good and services to and from a city (&#8216;transboundary embedded/embodied GHG emissions&#8217;) are included in a given urban emissions account.

CIF connects essential infrastructure use and demand activities in cities with their production, by combining TA emissions with the transboundary supply chain emissions associated with imported electricity, fuels, food, water, building materials, and waste management  services  used  in  cities  (Ramaswami  et  al.  2008;  Kennedy  et  al.  2009;  Chavez  and Ramaswami 2013).  </span></div><div style="" id="id3213"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3214">CBCF  considers  not  only  the  supply-chain-related  GHG  emissions  of  key  infrastructure,  but  also emissions associated with all goods and services across a city, often removing emissions associated with goods and services exported from a city (Wiedmann et al. 2016, 2021). The distinction between the PCF and ACF variants of the CBCF are primarily associated with whether the agents responsible for the final demand are confined to only city residents (PCF) or all consumers in a city (ACF), which can include government consumers, capital formation, and other final demand categories (Heinonen et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="" id="id3222"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3223">A recent synthesis of these frameworks in the context of a net zero GHG emissions target suggests that the four frameworks contribute to different aspects of decarbonization policy and can work together to inform  the  overall  process  of  decarbonization  (Ramaswami  et  al.  2021).  Furthermore,  the  relative magnitude  of  GHG  emissions  for  a  given  city  resulting  from  the  different  frameworks  is  often  a reflection of the city&#8217;s economic structure as a &#8216;consumer-&#8217; or producer city&#8217; (Chavez and Ramaswami 2013; Sudmant et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id3251"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3252">The PCF version of the CBCF shifts the focus of the consumption and associated supply chain emissions </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3254">to only household consumption of goods and services (Jones and Kammen 2014).

Across 74 metropolitan areas around the world, an estimated 408,270 lives per year  are  saved  due  to  air  quality  improvements  that  stem  from  a  move  to  100%  renewable  energy (Jacobson et al. 2020). Other studies indicate that there is potential to reduce premature mortality by up to 7,000 people in 53 towns and cities, to create 93,000 new jobs, and to lower global climate costs and personal energy costs, through renewable energy transformations (Jacobson et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id3833"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3834">Across 146 signatories of a city climate network, local energy-savings measures led to 6,596 avoided premature deaths and 68,476 years of life saved due to improved air quality (Monforti-Ferrario et al. 2018).

Additionally, authorities can sell energy generated from wastewater recycling to compensate for the wastewater management costs (Colenbrander et al. 2017; Gondhalekar and Ramsauer 2017). Another measure that contributes to reducing household costs is the promotion of behavioural measures such as dietary  changes  that  can  decrease  the  demand  for  costly  food  sources  and  reduce  healthcare  costs through promoting healthy diets (Hoppe et al. 2016) (see Sections 8.4.5 and 8.4.6). </span></div><div style="" id="id4205"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4206">In addition to cost savings, various measures such as stormwater management and urban greening can enhance social equity and environmental justice.

To achieve such benefits, however, the costs of integrating green and blue infrastructure and passive design measures into building design would need to be minimized.

For instance, in some contexts, high-density areas that lack adequate provision of green and open spaces may intensify the UHI effect (Pierer and Creutzig 2019; Xu et al. 2019). There are also concerns that some mitigation efforts may diminish adaptive capacity of urban poor and marginalized groups through increasing costs of urban services and/or eroding livelihood options. Environmental policies designed to  meet  mitigation  targets  through  phasing  out  old  vehicles  may  erode  livelihood  options  of  poor households, thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity (Colenbrander et al. 2017).

Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2019) (see WGII Section 6.2.2.1, WGII Figure 6.3, and WGIII Sections 8.2 and 8.3.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id4579"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4580">Urban systems are now global, as evidenced by the interdependencies between infrastructure, services, and networks driven by urban production and consumption; remittance flows and investments reach into rural places shaping natural resource use far from the city and bring risk to the city when these places are impacted by climate change (see WGIII Sections 8.4 and WGIII Figure 8.15).

This is typically observed in countries with a large urban-rural disparity in income and basic services, and where urbanization is accompanied by economic growth that is coupled to emissions. In addition, the outward expansion of urban land areas often results in the conversion and loss of agricultural land (Pandey et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019), forests (Austin et al. 2019), and  other  vegetated  areas,  thereby  reducing  carbon  uptake  and  storage  (Quesada  et  al.  2018)  (see Section  8.3.1).  Furthermore,  the  build-up  and  use  of  urban  infrastructure  (e.g.,  buildings,  power, sanitation) requires large amounts of embodied energy and carbon (see Figures 8.17 and 8.22). Building new and upgrading existing urban infrastructure could produce a cumulative emissions of 226 GtCO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id6703">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6704"> by 2050 (Bai et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id6707"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6708">However, for the same level of consumption and basic services, an average urban dweller often requires less  energy  than  their  rural  counterparts,  due  to  higher  population  densities  that  enable  sharing  of infrastructure and services, and economies of scale. Whether and to what extent such emission reduction potentials can be realized depends on how cities are designed and laid out (i.e., urban form &#8211; see Section 8.4.2) as well as how urban infrastructure is built and powered, such as the energy intensity of the city&#8217;s transportation system, type and level of urban services, the share of renewable energy, as well as the broader national and international economic and energy structure that supports the function of the cities (see Sections 8.4.3 and 8.6). </span></div><div style="" id="id6717"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6718">Although population-dense cities can be more efficient than rural areas in terms of per capita energy use, and cities contribute less GHG emissions per person than low-density suburbs (Jones and Kammen 2014), there is some, albeit </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6721">limited</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6722">, evidence that larger cities are not more efficient than smaller ones (Fragkias et al. 2013; Ribeiro et al. 2019).

There is some evidence that the benefits of higher urban densities on reducing per capita urban GHG emissions may be offset by higher incomes, smaller  household sizes,  and, most importantly,  higher consumption levels,  thus  creating  a  counter-effect that could increase GHG emissions with urbanization (Gill and Moeller 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id6732"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6733">Many studies have shown that the relationship between urbanization and GHG emissions is dependent </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6735">on  the  level  and  stage  of  urban  development,  and  follows  an  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  of  the environmental Kuznets curve (Wang et al. 2016, 2022; Zhang et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018a; Zhou et al. 2019)  (see  Sections  8.3.1  and  8.6,  and  Figure  8.20).  Considering  existing  trends,  earlier  phases  of urbanization accompanied by  rapid industrialization, development  of secondary industries,  and high levels  of  economic  growth,  are  correlated  with  higher  levels  of  energy  consumption  and  GHG emissions. However, more mature phases of urbanization, with higher levels of economic development and establishment of the service sector, are correlated with lower levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions (Khan and Su 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id6817"/><div style="" id="id6864"><a name="41" id="id6865">Page 41</a></div>

Across  all  four  sets  of  forecasts,  current  urban  land  (circa  2015)  is  the largest in Developed Countries and in the Asia and Developing Pacific region, with approximately two-</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7012">thirds of the current urban extent occurring in those two regions (see Table 8.1 and Figure 8.10). The largest increases in urban land by 2050 are expected in the Asia and Developing Pacific and Developed Countries regions, across all the SSPs. However, the rate of increase in urban land in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East is significant and urban land could more than double by 2050. One-third of the studies conclude that the United States, China, and India will experience continued urban land expansion at least until 2050 (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b). However, Li et al. (2019) report that, after 2050, China could experience a decrease in the rate of urban land expansion, while growth will continue for India. This is not surprising since India&#8217;s </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7021">urban demographic transition will only get underway after the middle of the century, when the urban population is expected to exceed the rural population.

By 2100, however, the Developed Countries region is expected to have the most urban expansion only in SSP5. In SSP2 and SSP4, the Developed Countries and Asia and Developing Pacific regions have about equal amounts of new urban land; in SSP3, Asia and Developing Pacific has more new urban land forecasted. </span></div><div style="" id="id7118"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7119">Fourth, both the range of estimates and their implications on land-use competition and urban life point to  an  opportunity  for  urban  areas  to  consider  their  urban  form  when  developing.  Under  the  current urbanization  trajectory,  50&#8211;63%  of  newly  expanded  urban  areas  are  expected  to  occur  on  current croplands (Chen et al. 2020a). However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and 2040, 12.5%  of  cropland  in  China  and  7.5%  of  cropland  in  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  could  be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017). As urban clusters increase in size and green space is converted, future urban land expansion is expected to intensify UHIs and exacerbate  night-time extreme temperatures. An urban footprint increase of 78&#8211;171% by 2050 over the urban footprint in 2015 is expected to result in average summer daytime and night-time warming in air temperature of 0.5&#176;C&#8211;0.7&#176;C, even up to about 3&#176;C in certain locations (Huang et  al.  2019).  Furthermore,  this  urban  expansion-induced  warming  is  on  average  about  half&#8212;and  in certain locations nearly twice&#8212;as strong as warming that will be caused by GHG emissions based on the multi-model ensemble average forecasts in RCP4.5. In short, future urban expansion will amplify the background warming caused by GHG emissions, with extreme warming most pronounced during night-time (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7134">very high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7135"> (Huang et al. 2019).

These  factors include  potential  changes  in  the  social,  economic,  and  institutional  dynamics  that  drive  urban  land development across the world (G&#252;neralp and Seto 2013). Some of these changes may come in the form of sudden shocks such as another global economic crisis or pandemic. The forecasts presented here do not take such factors into account. </span></div><div style="" id="id7225"/><div style="" id="id7274"><a name="43" id="id7275">Page 43</a></div>

A  fourth,  socio-behavioural aspects, can shift energy demand and emerge as the result of implementing the strategies.

These cascading effects take place  both  within and  across  urban  systems  (see  Figure  8.15). Mitigation actions also  occur at multiple urban scales, from households and blocks to districts and city regions, and can be implemented as standalone sectoral strategies, such as increasing energy efficiency for appliances, and also as system-wide  actions.  In  reducing  emissions  locally,  urban  areas  can  help  lower  emissions  outside  of  their administrative boundaries through their use of materials and resources, and by increasing the efficiency of  infrastructure  and  energy  use  beyond  what  is  possible  with  individual  sectoral  strategies.  Urban mitigation  policies  that  implement  multiple  integrated  interventions  will  provide  more  emissions savings than the sum of individual interventions (Sethi et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id9836"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id9837">Integrated  action  also  has  a  key  role  in  providing  benefits  for  human  well-being.

Due  to  the  complex  and  intensive interactions  in  urban  systems  and  the  interlinked  nature  among  the  SDGs,  cities  can  be  important intervention points to harness synergies and co-benefits for achieving emissions reductions along with other SDGs (Nilsson et al. 2016; Corbett and Mellouli 2017) (see Section 8.2 and Figure 8.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id9935"/><div style="" id="id10009"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10010">Panel a) </span></div><div style="" id="id10032"/><div style="" id="id10122"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10123">Panel b) </span></div><div style="" id="id10125"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10126">Figure 8.15 Urban systems, lock-in, and cascading effects of mitigation strategies.  </span></div><div style="" id="id10128"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10129">Cities are systems of inter-connected sectors, activities, and governance structures.

Mitigation efforts implemented at larger scales of governance or in sectors that transcend urban boundaries, like energy and transportation, can also facilitate and amplify mitigation at the urban scale, as shown by the arrows extending in both directions across layers (a).

Urban carbon lock-is strongly determined by urban form, in particular the layout of streets and land-use mix. The different coloured spatial patterns represent varying levels of co-location of housing and jobs, and mobility options (also see Figure 8.16).

The way that urban areas are designed, laid out, and built affects and is affected by the interactions across the different forms of carbon lock-in (see Figures 8.15 and 8.16). Cities are especially prone to carbon lock-in because of the multiple interactions  of  technological,  institutional,  and  behavioural  systems,  which  create  inertia  and  path dependency  that  are  difficult  to  break.  For  example,  the  lock-in  of  gasoline  cars  is  reinforced  by highway  and  energy  infrastructures  that  are  further  locked-in  by  social  and  cultural  preferences  for individual mobility options. The dominance of cars and their supporting infrastructures in auto-centric urban forms is further reinforced by zoning and urban development patterns, such as dispersed and low-density housing distantly located from jobs, that create obstacles to create alternative mobility options (Seto et al. 2016) (see Figure 8.16 on urban form). (Linton et al. 2021) </span></div><div style="" id="id10304"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10305">Urban infrastructures and the built environment are long-lived assets, embodying triple carbon lock-ins in terms of their construction, operations, and demolition (Creutzig et al. 2016b; Seto et al. 2016; &#220;rge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). There is much focus in the climate change literature on the operational lifetimes of the energy sector, especially power plants and the electricity grid, which are between 30 and 60 years (Rode et al. 2017). Yet, in reality, the lifespans of urban infrastructures, especially the basic layout of roadways, are often much longer (Reyna and Chester 2015). A number of detailed case studies on the evolution of urban road networks for cities around the world reveal that the current layout of streets grew out of street networks that were established hundreds of years ago (Strano et al. 2012; Masucci et al. 2013; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson 2014). Furthermore, there is evidence that urban street layout, population growth, urban development, and automobile ownership co-evolve (Li et al. 2019a).  </span></div><div style="" id="id10316"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10317">For cities to break out of mutually reinforcing carbon lock-in, it will require systematic transformation and systems-based planning that integrates mitigation strategies across sectors and geo-political scales. Urban  energy  demand  patterns  are  locked-in  whenever  incremental  urban  design  and  planning decisions, coupled with investments in long-lasting infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, take place (Seto et al. 2016). The fundamental building blocks of cities are based on the layout of the street network, the size of city blocks, and the density of street intersections. If not significantly altered, these three  factors  will  continue  to  shape  and  lock-in  energy  demand  for  decades  after  their  initial construction, influencing the mitigation potential of urban areas (see Section 8.4.2 and Figure 8.22). </span></div><div style="" id="id10326"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10327">Avoiding carbon lock-in inherently involves decisions that extend beyond the administrative boundaries of cities.

Specifically,  low-carbon cities have the following characteristics: (1) co-located medium to high densities of housing, jobs, and commerce; (2) high mix of land uses; (3) high connectivity of streets; and (4) high levels of accessibility,  distinguished  by  relatively  low  travel  distances  and  travel  times  that  are  enabled  by multiple modes of transportation. Urban areas with these features tend to have smaller dwelling units, smaller parcel sizes, walking opportunities, high density of intersections, and are highly accessible to shopping. For brevity, we will refer to these characteristics collectively as &#8216;compact and walkable urban form&#8217; (see Figure 8.16). Compact and walkable urban form has many co-benefits, including mental and physical health, lower resource demand, and saving land for AFOLU. In contrast, dispersed and auto-centric urban form is correlated with higher GHG emissions, and characterized by separated land uses, low population and job densities, large block size, and low intersection density.  </span></div><div style="" id="id10482"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10483">Figure 8.16 Urban form and implications for GHG emissions </span></div><div style="" id="id10485"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10486">Compact and walkable urban form is strongly correlated with low GHG emissions and characterized by co-located medium to high densities of housing and jobs, high street density, small block size, and mixed land use (Seto et al. 2014). Higher population densities at places of origin (e. g., home) and destination (e. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id10490">g., employment, shopping) concentrate demand and are necessary for achieving the ASI approach for sustainable mobility (see Chapters 5 and 10). Dispersed and auto-centric urban form is strongly correlated with high GHG emissions, and characterized by separated land uses, especially of housing and jobs, low street density, large block sizes, and low urban densities. Separated and low densities of employment, retail, and housing increase average travel distances for both work and leisure, and make active transport and modal shift a challenge. Since cities are systems, urban form has interacting implications across energy, buildings, transport, land use, and individual behaviour. Compact and walkable urban form enables effective mitigation while dispersed and auto-centric urban form locks-in higher levels of energy use. The colours represent different land uses and indicate varying levels of co-location and mobility options. </span></div><div style="" id="id10516"/><div style="" id="id10556"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10557">Final Government Distribution  </span></div><div style="" id="id10559"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10560">Chapter 8 </span></div><div style="" id="id10562"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10563">IPCC AR6 WGIII </span></div><div style="" id="id10625"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10626">especially  regarding  the  mitigation  benefits  associated  with  reducing  vehicle  miles  or  kilometres travelled  (VMT/VKT)  through  spatial  planning.

However, these benefits can be attained only when the existing spatial structure of an urban area  does  not  limit  locational  and  mobility  options,  thereby  avoiding  carbon  lock-in  through  the interaction of infrastructure and the resulting socio-behavioural aspects. </span></div><div style="" id="id10633"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10634">Modifying  the  layout  of  emerging  urbanization  to  be  more  compact,  walkable,  and  co-located  can reduce future urban energy use by 20&#8211;25% in 2050 while providing a corresponding mitigation potential of 23&#8211;26% (Creutzig et al. 2015, 2016b; Sethi et al. 2020), forming the basis for other urban mitigation options. Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 10 provides perspectives on simultaneously reducing urban transport emissions, avoiding infrastructure lock-in, and providing accessible services (see Chapter 10).

Spatial strategies that integrate the 5Ds are shown to reduce VMT/VKT, and thereby transport-related  GHG  emissions  through  energy  savings.  The  effect  of  urban  form  and  built  environment strategies on VMT per capita varies by a number of factors (Ewing and Cervero 2010; Stevens 2017; Blanco and Wikstrom 2018). Density and destination accessibility have the highest elasticities, followed by design (Stevens 2017). Population-weighted densities for 121 metropolitan areas have further found that  the  concentration  of  population  and  jobs  along  mass  transit  corridors  decreases  VMT/VKT significantly when compared to more dispersed metropolitan areas.

In addition to population density, land-use mix, rail transit accessibility, and street design reduce emissions from transport (Dou et al. 2016; Cao and Yang 2017; Choi 2018). The impact of population density and urban compactness on emissions per capita in the  household  or  energy  sector  is  also  associated  with  socioeconomic  characteristics  or  lifestyle preferences  (Baiocchi  et  al.  2015;  Miao  2017).

Understanding  the  existing  trade-offs  (or  synergetic  links)  between  urban  form variables across major emissions source sectors, and how they impact the size of energy flows within the urban system, is key to prioritizing action for energy-efficient spatial planning strategies, which are likely to vary across urban areas. </span></div><div style="" id="id10766"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10767">8.4.2.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10769">Urban form, growth, and sustainable development</span></div><div style="" id="id10772"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10773">Spatial  planning  for  compact  urban  form  is  a  system-wide  intervention  (Sethi  et  al.  2020)  and  has potential to be combined with sustainable development objectives while pursuing climate mitigation for urban systems (Gro&#223;e et al. 2016; Cheshmehzangi and Butters 2017; Facchini et al. 2017; Lwasa 2017; Stokes and Seto 2019).

District heating and cooling networks benefit from urban design parameters, including density, block area, and elongation that represent the influence of urban density on energy density  (Fonseca  and  Schlueter  2015;  Shi  et  al.  2020).  Heat-demand  density  is  a  function  of  both population density and heat demand per capita and can be equally present in urban areas with high population  density  or  high  heat  demand  per  capita  (M&#246;ller  et  al.  2019;  Persson  et  al.  2019).  Low-temperature networks that utilize waste heat or renewable energy can provide an option to avoid carbon lock-in to fossil fuels while layout and eco-design principles can further optimize such networks (Gang et al. 2016; Buffa et al. 2019; Dominkovi&#263; and Kraja&#269;i&#263; 2019).

The environmental and ecological benefits increase through the interaction of urban energy and spatial planning (Tuomisto et al. 2015; Bartolozzi et al. 2017; D&#233;nari&#233; et al. 2018; Zhai et al. 2020). These interactions include support for demand-side flexibility, spatial planning using geographic information systems, and access to  renewable  and  urban  waste heat  sources  (M&#246;ller  et  al. 2018;  REN21  2020;  Sorkn&#230;s  et  al.  2020; Doroti&#263; et al. 2019) (see Table SM8.2 for other references).   </span></div><div style="" id="id10958"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10959">8.4.3</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id10961">Electrification and switching to net zero emissions resources </span></div><div style="" id="id10963"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10964">Pursuing the electrification mobility, heating, and cooling systems, while decarbonizing electricity and energy carriers, and switching to net zero materials and supply chains, represent important strategies for urban mitigation.

Indeed,  electrification  is  already  transforming  urban  areas  and settlements and has the potential to continue transforming urban areas into net-negative electric cities that may sequester more carbon than emitted (Kennedy et al. 2018; Seto et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id11213"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11214">In its simplest form, electrification involves the process of replacing fossil fuel-based technologies with electrified innovations such as electric vehicles, buses, streetcars, and trains (see Sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.2), heat pumps,  PVs (see Section 6.4.2.1), electric  cook-stoves (see Section  9.8.2.1), and other technologies (Stewart et al. 2018). Cost-effective decarbonisation of energy use can be supported by electrification in urban areas if there is also demand-side flexibility for power, heat, mobility, and water with sector coupling (Guelpa et al. 2019; Pfeifer et al. 2021). Overall, demand-side flexibility across sectors in urban areas is supported by smart charging, electric mobility, electrified urban rail, power-to-heat, demand side response, and water desalination (Lund et al. 2015; Calvillo et al. 2016; Salpakari et al. 2016; Newman 2017; Meschede 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id11224"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11225">As an enabler, electrification supports integrating net zero energy sources in urban infrastructure across sectors,  especially  when  there  is  more  flexible  energy  demand  in  mobility,  heating,  and  cooling  to absorb greater shares of variable renewable energy.

The parallel-to-grain strength of mass (engineered) timber is similar to that of reinforced concrete (Ramage et al. 2017). As much as half the weight of a given volume of wood is carbon, sequestered during forest growth as a by-product of photosynthesis (Martin et al. 2018). Mass timber is inflammable, but in large sections forms a self-protective charring layer when exposed to fire that will protect the remaining &#8216;cold wood&#8217; core. This property, formed as massive structural sections, is recognized in the fire safety regulations of building codes in several countries, which allow mid- and high-rise buildings in timber.

Cement ratios of 10%, 15%, and 20% are assumed to estimate minimum, mean, and maximum carbon storage in concrete. Carbon storage of steel is not displayed as it is negligible (0.004 tonne C per tonne of steel).

Green roofs have the highest median cooling effect in dry climates (3&#176;C) and the lowest cooling effect in hot, humid climates (1&#176;C)  (Jamei et al. 2021). These  mitigation  potentials  depend  on  numerous  factors  and  the  scale  of  implementation.  The temperature reduction potential for green roofs when compared to conventional roofs can be about 4&#176;C in winter and about 12&#176;C during summer conditions (Bevilacqua et al. 2016). Green roofs can reduce building heating demands by about 10&#8211;30% compared to conventional roofs (Besir and Cuce 2018), 60&#8211;70% compared to black roofs, and 45&#8211;60% compared to white roofs (Silva et al. 2016). Green walls or facades can provide a temperature difference between air temperature outside and behind a green wall of up to 10&#176;C, with an average difference of 5&#176;C in Mediterranean contexts in Europe (Perini et al. 2017). The potential of saving energy for air conditioning by green facades can be around 26% in summer months. Considerations of the spatial context are essential given their dependence on climatic conditions (Susca 2019). Cities are diverse and emissions savings potentials depend on several factors, while the implementation of green roofs or facades may be prevented in heritage structures. </span></div><div style="" id="id13118"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13119">Green roofs have been shown to have beneficial effects in stormwater reduction (Andr&#233;s-Dom&#233;nech et </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13121">al. 2018). A global meta-analysis of 75 international studies on the potential of green roofs to mitigate runoff  indicate  that  the  runoff  retention  rate  was  on  average  62%  but  with  a  wide  range  (0&#8211;100%) depending  on  a  number  of  interdependent  factors  (Zheng  et  al.  2021).  These  factors  relate  to  the characteristics of the rainfall event (e.g., intensity) and characteristics of the green roof (e.g., substrate, vegetation type, and size), and of the climate and season type. A hydrologic modelling approach applied to an Italian case demonstrated that implementing green roofs may reduce peak runoff rates and water volumes by up to 35% in a 100% green roof conversion scenario (Masseroni and Cislaghi 2016). </span></div><div style="" id="id13129"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13130">Greenways support stormwater management to mitigate water runoff and urban floods by reducing the water volume (e.g., through infiltration) and by an attenuation or temporal shift of water discharge (Fiori and Volpi 2020; Pour et al. 2020). Using green infrastructure delays the time to runoff and reduces water volume but depends on the magnitude of floods (Qin et al. 2013). Measures are most effective for flood mitigation at a local scale; however, as the size of the catchment increases, the effectiveness of  reducing  peak  discharge  decreases  (Fiori  and  Volpi  2020).  Reduction  of  water  volume  through infiltration  can  be  more  effective  with  rainfall  events  on  a  lower  return  rate.  Overall,  the  required capacity for piped engineered systems for water runoff attenuation and mitigation can be reduced while lowering  flow  rates,  controlling  pollution  transport, and  increasing  the  capacity  to  store  stormwater (Srishantha and Rathnayake 2017). Benefits for flood mitigation require a careful consideration of the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13141">spatial  context  of  the  urban  area,  the  heterogeneity  of  the  rainfall  events,  and  characteristics  of implementation  (Qiu et al. 2021).

The relative availability of options across these sectors has implications on urban emissions through  individual  behaviour.  In  turn,  urban  GHG  emissions,  as  well  as  emissions  from  the  supply chains of cities, are driven by the behaviour and consumption patterns of residents, with households accounting  for  over  60%  of  carbon  emissions  globally  (Ivanova  et  al.  2016).  The  exclusion  of consumption-based emissions and emissions that occur outside of city boundaries as a result of urban activities  will  lead  to  significant  undercounting  to  the  effect  of  undercounting  41%  of  territorial emissions and 4% of global emissions annually, respectively (Wiedmann et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id13316"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13317">Changes in behaviour across all areas (e.g., transport, buildings, food, etc.) could reduce an individual&#8217;s emissions by 5.6&#8211;16.2% relative to the accumulated GHG emissions from 2011 to 2050 in a baseline scenario modelled with the Global Change Assessment Model (van de Ven et al. 2018).

Voluntary behaviour change can support emissions reduction, but behaviours that are not convenient to change are unlikely to shift without changes to policy (Sk&#246;ld et al. 2018). Cities can increase the capability of citizens to make sustainable choices by making these choices less onerous, through avenues such as changing urban form to increase locational and mobility options and providing feedback mechanisms to support socio-behavioural change. </span></div><div style="" id="id13329"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13330">Transport emissions can be reduced by options including telecommuting (0.3%), taking closer holidays (0.5%), avoiding short flights (0.5%), using public transit (0.7%), cycling (0.6%), car sharing (1.1%), and carpool commuting (1.2%); all reduction estimates reflect cumulative per capita emission savings relative to baseline emissions for the period 2011&#8211;2050, and assume immediate adoption of behavioural changes (van de Ven et al. 2018). Cities can support voluntary shift to walking, cycling, and transit instead of car use through changes to urban form, such as TOD (Kamruzzaman et al. 2015), increased density of form with co-location of activities (Ma et al. 2015; Ding et al. 2017; Duranton and Turner </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13338">2018; Masoumi 2019), and greater intersection density and street integration (Koohsari et al. 2016).

It holds promise  for  targeting  and  obtaining  greater  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  in  household  travel  by providing access through walking, biking, and public transit. Accessibility as a criterion for urban form has been embedded in neighbourhood form models since at least the last century and in more recent decades in the urban village concept of the New Urbanism (Duany and Plater-Zyberck 1991) and TODs (Calthorpe  1993).  However,  accessibility  did  not  gain  much  traction  in  urban  planning  and transportation until the last decade. The experience of cities and metropolitan areas with the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a further resurgence in interest and importance (Handy 2020; Hu et al. 2020), and is becoming a criterion at the core of the concept of the 15/20-minute city (Moreno et al. 2021; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021). Initially, neighbourhoods have been designed to provide quality, reliable services within 15 or 20 minutes of active transport (i.e., walking or cycling), as well as a variety of housing options and open space (Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability 2012; Pozoukidou and  Chatziyiannaki  2021;  State  Government  of  Victoria  2021).  Community  life  circles  strategy  for urban areas have also emphasized walking access and health (Weng et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021).

Home  composting  and  compact  urban  form  can  also  reduce  waste transport  emissions  (Oliveira  et  al.  2017).  Decentralized  waste  management  can  reinforce  source-separation behaviour since the resulting benefits can be more visible (Eisted et al. 2009; Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012; Linzner and Lange 2013). Public acceptance for waste management is greatest when system costs for citizens are reduced, there is greater awareness of primary waste separation at source, and there are positive behavioural spill-over across environmental  policies  (Milutinovi&#263; et al. 2016; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; D&#237;az-Villavicencio et al. 2017; Slorach et al. 2020). In addition to the choice of technology, the costs of waste management options depends on the awareness of system users that can represent time-dependent costs (Khan et al. 2016; Chifari et al. 2017; Ranieri et al. 2018; Tomi&#263; and Schneider 2020). Waste management systems and the inclusion of materials from multiple urban sectors for alternative by-products can increase scalability (Eriksson et al. 2015; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017;  D&#8217;Adamo  et  al.  2021).  As  a  broader  concept, circular  economy  approaches  can  contribute to managing waste (see Box 12.2) with varying emissions impacts (see Section 5.3.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id13685"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13686">The generation and composition of waste varies considerably from region to region and city to city. So do  the  levels  of  institutional  management,  infrastructure,  and  (informal)  work  in  waste  disposal activities. Depending on context, policy priorities are directed towards reducing waste generation and transforming waste to energy or other products in a circular economy (Diaz 2017; Ezeudu and Ezeudu 2019; Joshi et al. 2019; Calder&#243;n M&#225;rquez and Rutkowski 2020; Fatimah et al. 2020). Similarly, waste generation, waste collection coverage, recycling, and composting rates, as well as the means of waste disposal  and  treatment,  differ  widely,  including  the  logistics  of  urban  waste  management  systems. Multiple factors influence waste generation, and regions with similar urbanization rates can generate different levels of waste per capita (Kaza et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id13696"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13697">Under conventional practices, municipal solid waste is projected to increase by about 1.4 Gt between 2016 and 2050, reaching 3.4 Gt in 2050 (Kaza et al. 2018). Integrated policymaking can increase the energy, material, and emissions benefits in the waste management sector (Hjalmarsson 2015; Fang et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017). Organisational structure and program administration poses demands for institutional capacity, governance, and cross-sectoral coordination for obtaining the maximum benefit (Hjalmarsson 2015; Kalmykova et al. 2016; Conke 2018; Marino et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id13704"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13705">The  informal  sector  plays  a  critical  role  in  waste  management,  particularly  but  not  exclusively  in developing  countries  (Linzner  and  Lange  2013;  Dias  2016).

Balancing centralized and decentralized waste management options along low-carbon objectives can address potential challenges in transforming informality (de Bercegol and Gowda 2019).

Integrated  waste management  and  zero-waste  targets  can allow  urban  areas  to  maximize the mitigation potential while reducing pressures on land use and the environment. This mitigation option reduces emissions due to (1) avoided emissions upstream in the supply chain of materials based on measures for recycling and the reuse of materials, (2) avoided emissions due to land use changes as well as emissions that are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal, and (3) avoided primary energy (see  Glossary)  spending  and  emissions.  Socio-behavioural  change  that  reduces  waste  generation combined  with  technology  and  infrastructure  according  to  the  waste  hierarchy  can  be  especially effective. The mitigation potential of waste-to-energy depends on the technological choices that are undertaken (e.g., anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction), the emissions factor of the energy mix that it replaces, and its broader role within integrated municipal solid management practices (Eriksson et al. 2015; Potdar et al. 2016; Yu and Zhang 2016; Soares and Martins 2017; Alzate-Arias et al. 2018; Islam 2018).

Managing food waste in urban areas through recycling or reduction of food waste at source of consumption would require behavioural change (Gu et al. 2019). Urban governments could also support shifts towards more climate-friendly diets, including through procurement policies. These strategies have created economic opportunities  or  have  enhanced  food  security  while  reducing  the  emissions  that  are  associated  with waste and the transportation of food.

Local governments can minimize trade-offs associated with electrification technologies by enabling circular economy practices and opportunities (Pan et al. 2015; Gaustad et al. 2018; Sovacool et al. 2020). These include  public-private  partnerships  between  consumers  and  producers,  financial  and  institutional support,  and  networking  for  stakeholders  like  entrepreneurs,  so  as  to  increase  accessibility  and efficiency  of  recycling  for  consumers  by  providing  a  clear  path  from  consumer  waste  back  to  the producers (Pan et al. 2015; Prendeville et al. 2018; Fratini et al. 2019).

The capacity of  subnational  governments  to  autonomously  pursue emissions  reductions  on  their  own  depends  on different political systems and other aspects of multilevel governance, such as innovation, legitimacy, and  institutional  fit,  as  well  as  the  resources,  capacity,  and  knowledge  available  to  subnational technicians and other officials (Widerberg and Pattberg 2015; Valente de Macedo et al. 2016; Green 2017; Roger et al. 2017). Financing is considered one of the most crucial facets of urban climate change mitigation. It is also considered one of the biggest barriers given the limited financial capacities of local and regional governments (see Section 8.5.4 and 8.5.5).  </span></div><div style="" id="id14462"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14463">When sufficient local autonomy is present, local policies have the ability to upscale to higher levels of authority imparting influence at higher geographic scales. Established urban climate leaders with large institutional  capacity  can  influence  small  and  mid-sized  cities,  or  other  urban  areas  with  less institutional  capacity,  to  enact  effective  climate  policies,  by  engaging  with  those  cities  through transnational networks and by adopting a public presence of climate leadership (Chan et al. 2015; Kern 2019; Seto et al. 2021) (see Section 8.5.3). Increasingly, subnational actors are also influencing their national  and  international  governments  through  lobbying  efforts  that  call  on  them  to  adopt  more ambitious  climate  goals  and  provide  more  support  for  subnational  GHG  mitigation  effort.  These dynamics underscore the importance of relative local autonomy in urban GHG mitigation policy. They also highlight the growing recognition of subnational authorities&#8217; role in climate change mitigation by </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14474">national and international authorities.  </span></div><div style="" id="id14476"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14477">The  confluence  of  political  will  and  policy  action  at  the  local  level,  and  growing  resources  offered through municipal and regional networks and agreements, have provided a platform for urban actors to engage in international climate policy (see Section 8.5.3). This phenomena is recognized in the Paris Agreement,  which,  for  the  first  time  in  a  multilateral  climate  treaty,  referenced  the  crucial  role subnational  and  nonstate  actors  like  local  communities  have  in  meeting  the  goals  set  forth  in  the agreement (UNFCCC 2015).

Shanghai was designated as one of the pilot low-carbon cities by the central government. The city utilized a coordination mechanism for joining  fragmented  policymaking  across  the  city&#8217;s  economy,  energy,  and  environment.  The coordination mechanism was supported by a direct fund that enabled implementation of cross-sector policies beyond a single-sector focus across multiple institutions while increasing capacity for enabling a low carbon transition for urban sustainability (Peng and Bai 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id14646"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14647">Implementation and governance process </span></div><div style="" id="id14649"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14650">In  Shanghai,  coordination  between  the  central  and  local  governments  had  an  instrumental  role  for encouraging  low-carbon  policy  experimentation.  Using  a  nested  governance  framework,  the  central government provided target setting and performance evaluation while the local government initiated pilot projects for low-carbon development. The policy practices in Shanghai surpassed the top-down targets and annual reporting of GHG emissions, including carbon labelling standards at the local level, pilot programs for transitioning sub-urban areas, and the engagement of public utilities (Peng and Bai 2018).   </span></div><div style="" id="id14658"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14659">Towards low-carbon urban development </span></div><div style="" id="id14661"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14662">New policy measures in Shanghai were built upon a series of related policies from earlier, ranging from general energy saving measures to air pollution reduction. This provided a continuum of policy learning for implementing low-carbon policy measures. An earlier policy was a green electricity scheme based on the Jade Electricity Program while the need for greater public awareness was one aspect requiring further attention in policy design (Baeumler et al. 2012), supporting policy-learning for policies later on. The key point here is that low-carbon policies were built on and learned from earlier policies with similar goals.  </span></div><div style="" id="id14670"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14671">Outcomes and impacts of the policy mix </span></div><div style="" id="id14673"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14674">Trends during 1998 and 2015 indicate that energy intensity decreased from about 130 ton per million RMB to about 45 ton per million RMB and carbon intensity decreased from about 0.35 Mt per billion RMB to 0.10 Mt per billion RMB (Peng and Bai 2018).

In  some countries, such as the United States, where national climate policies have been curtailed, the potential for cities and regions&#8217; emissions reduction pledges to make up the country&#8217;s Paris NDC is assessed to be significant (Kuramochi et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="" id="id14850"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14851">These estimates are also often contingent on assumptions that subnational actors fulfil their pledges and that  these  actions  do  not  result  in  rollbacks  in  climate  action  (i.e.,  weakening  of  national  climate legislation)  from  other  actors  or  rebound  in  emissions  growth  elsewhere,  but  data  tracking  or quantifying the likelihood of their implementation remains rare (Chan et al. 2018; Hsu et al. 2019; Hale et al. 2020; Kuramochi et al. 2020). Reporting networks may attract high-performing cities, suggesting an artificially high level of cities interested in taking climate action or piloting solutions that may not be effective elsewhere (van der Heijden 2018). These studies could also present a conservative view of potential mitigation impact because they draw upon publicly reported mitigation actions and inventory data, excluding subnational actors that may be taking actions but not reporting them (Kuramochi et al. 2020).  The  nuances  of  likelihood,  and  the  drivers  and  obstacles  of  climate  action  across  different contexts is a key source of uncertainty around subnational actors&#8217; mitigation impacts.  </span></div><div style="" id="id14863"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id14864">8.5.3</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id14866">Urban climate networks and transnational governance </span></div><div style="" id="id14868"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14869">As of 2019, more than 10,000 cities and regions (Hsu et al. 2020a) have recorded participation in a transnational or cooperative climate action network, which are voluntary membership networks of a range  of  subnational  governments  such  as  cities,  as  well  as  regional  governments  like  states  and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14873">provinces  (Hsu  et  al.  2020a).

Urban  governments  often  obtain  their powers from provincial, state and/or national governments, and are subjected to laws and regulations to regulate development and implement infrastructure. In addition, the sources of revenue are often set at these levels so that many urban governments rely on state/provincial and national government funds for improving  infrastructure,  especially  transit  infrastructure.  The  increasing  financialisation  of  urban infrastructures  is  another  factor  that  can  make  it  more  difficult  for  local  governments  to  determine infrastructure choices (O&#8217;Brien et al. 2019). Urban transit system operations, in particular, are heavily subsidized  in  many  countries,  both  locally  and  by  higher  levels  of  government.  As  a  result  of  this interplay of policy and legal powers among various levels of government, the lock-in nature of urban infrastructures and built environments will require multi-level governance response to ensure meeting decarbonization  targets.

Nonetheless, the risk of high carbon lock-ins is likely to increase in rapidly growing cities if long-term urban mitigation strategies are not incorporated  into  short-term  economic  recovery  actions  (Granoff  et  al.  2016;  Floater  et  al.  2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; CPI and World Bank 2021; Negreiros et al. 2021). Indeed, large and complex infrastructure projects for urban mitigation are often beyond the capacity of both national government and local municipality budgets. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates large government expenditures  for  public  health  programs  and  decimates  municipal  revenue  sources  for  urban infrastructure projects in cities. </span></div><div style="" id="id15283"/><div style="" id="id15323"><a name="83" id="id15324">Page 83</a></div>

The lack of creditworthiness is one of the main problems preventing cities from issuing green municipal bonds in developing countries. As a prerequisite for the application of municipal debt-financing, it is an essential condition for cities to ensure sufficient own revenues from low-carbon urbanization, or the default risk becomes too high for potential investors.

Land value capture is expected not only for cities to generate additional revenue streams but also to prevent low-density urban expansion around city-fringe locations. Inversely, land value capture is supposed to perform well when accompanied by low-carbon urban form and private real estate investments along with the application of green building technologies (Suzuki et al. 2015; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b) (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15595">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15596">). </span></div><div style="" id="id15598"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15599">For the implementation of land-based funding, property rights are essential.

Improvements in air quality are possible when higher urban densities are combined with modes of active transport, electrified mobility as well as urban green and blue infrastructure (see Sections 8.3.4, 8.4 and 8.6). The demands on geophysical resources, including materials for urban development, will depend on whether additional strategies are in place with largely negative impacts under conventional practices. The technological scalability of multiple urban mitigation options is favourable while varying according to the level of existing urban development and scale of implementation (see Tables SM8.3 - SM8.4 in Supplementary Material 8.2).  </span></div><div style="" id="id15787"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15788">Similarly,  multiple  mitigation  options  have  positive  impacts  on  employment  and  economic  growth, especially  when  urban  densities  enable  productivity.

The electrification of the urban energy system involves multiple enablers that support the feasibility of this mitigation option, including positive impacts on health and well-being. In addition, increases in urban densities can support the planning of district heating and cooling networks that can decarbonize the built environment at scale with technology readiness levels increasing for lower temperature supply options. Preventing,  minimizing, and managing waste as an urban mitigation option can be enabled when informality in the sector is transformed to secure employment effects and value addition based on the more circular use of resources (see Tables SM8.3 and SM8.4 in Supplementary Material 8.2, and Sections 8.4.3 and 8.4.5).  </span></div><div style="" id="id15802"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15803">As a combined evaluation, integrating multiple mitigation options in urban systems involves the greatest requirement for strengthening institutional capacity and governance through cross-sectoral coordination (see  Section  8.4  and  8.6,  and  Figure  8.21).

This section brings together the urban mitigation options described in Section 8.4 and assesses the range of mitigation potentials for different types of cities. There is consensus in the literature that mitigation strategies are most effective when multiple interventions are coupled together. Urban-scale interventions that implement multiple strategies concurrently through policy packages are more  effective  and  have  greater  emissions  savings  than  when  single  interventions  are  implemented separately.  This  is  because  a  citywide  strategy  can  have  cascading  effects  across  sectors,  that  have multiplicative  effects  on  GHG  emissions  reduction  within  and  outside  a  city&#8217;s  administrative boundaries. Therefore, city-scale strategies can reduce more emissions than the net sum of individual interventions,  particularly  if  multiple  scales  of  governance  are  included  (see  Sections  8.4  and  8.5). Furthermore, cities have the ability to implement policy packages across sectors using an urban systems approach, such as through planning, particularly those that affect key infrastructures (see Figures 8.15, 8.17 and 8.22).  </span></div><div style="" id="id16056"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16057">The way that cities are laid out and built will shape the entry points for realising systemic transformation across urban form and infrastructure, energy systems, and supply chains. Section 8.3.1 discusses the ongoing trend of rapid urbanization&#8212;and how it varies through different forms of urban development or &#8216;typologies&#8217; (see Figure 8.6). Below, Figure 8.20 distils the typologies of urban growth across three categories:  emerging,  rapidly  growing,  and  established.  Urban  growth  is  relatively  stabilized  in established urban areas with mature urban form while newly taking shape in emerging urban areas. In contrast,  rapidly  growing  urban  areas  experience  pronounced  changes  in  outward  and/or  upward growth. These typologies are not mutually exclusive, and can co-exist within an urban system; cities typically  encompass  a  spectrum  of  development,  with  multiple  types  of  urban  form  and  various typologies (Mahtta et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id16068"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16069">Taken together, urban form (Figure 8.16) and growth typology (Figure 8.20) can act as a roadmap for cities or sub-city communities looking to identify their urban context and, by extension, the mitigation opportunities  with  the  greatest  potential  to  reduction  GHG  emissions.  Specifically,  this  considers whether a city is established with existing and managed infrastructure, rapidly growing with new and actively developing infrastructure, or emerging with large amounts of infrastructure build-up. The long lifespan of urban infrastructure locks in behaviour and committed emissions. Therefore, the sequencing of  mitigation  strategies  is  important  for  determining  emissions  savings  in  the  short-  and  long-term. Hence, different types of cities will have different mitigation pathways, depending upon a city&#8217;s urban form  and  state  of  that  city&#8217;s  urban  development  and  infrastructure;  the  policy  packages  and implementation plan that provide the highest mitigation potential for rapidly growing cities with new </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16080">infrastructures will differ from those for established cities with existing infrastructure. </span></div><div style="" id="id16082"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16083">Mitigation options that involve spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure&#8212;particularly co-located and mixed land use, as well as TOD&#8212;provide the greatest opportunities when urban areas are rapidly growing or emerging (see Section 8.4.2). Established urban areas that are already compact and walkable have  captured  mitigation  benefits  from  these  illustrative  strategies  to  various  extents.  Conversely, established urban areas that are dispersed and auto-centric have foregone these opportunities with the exception of urban infill and densification that can be used to transform or continue to transform the existing urban form.

Each of these typologies represents different levels of economic development and state of urbanization. Rapidly growing urban areas that are building up through vertical development are often those with higher levels of economic development. Rapidly growing urban areas that are building outward through horizontal expansion occurs at lower levels of economic development and are land intensive.

Urban areas can first locate their relative positioning in this space according to their predominant style of urban growth and urban form. The urban mitigation options are bundled across four broad sectors of mitigation strategies: (1) spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure (blue); (2) electrification and net zero emissions resources (yellow); (3) urban green and blue infrastructure (green); and (4) socio-behavioural aspects (purple).

The  impact  of  COVID-19  on  urban activity and urban GHG emissions may offer insights into urban emissions and their behavioural drivers and may include structural shifts in emissions that last into the future. The science is unclear as to the links between urban characteristics and COVID-19, and involves multiple aspects. For example, some research shows higher COVID-19 infection rates with city size (e.g.,  Dalziel et al. 2018; Stier et al. 2021), as well as challenges to epidemic preparedness due to high population density and high volume of public transportation (Layne et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020). Other research from 913 metropolitan areas shows that density is unrelated to COVID-19 infection rates and, in fact, has been inversely related to COVID-19 mortality rates when controlled by metropolitan population. </span></div><div style="" id="id17609"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17610">Dense counties are found to have significantly lower mortality rates, possibly due to such advantages as better health care systems as well as greater adherence to social-distancing measures (Hamidi et al. 2020). Sustainable  urbanization  and  urban  infrastructure  that  address  the  SDGs  can  also  improve preparedness and resilience against future pandemics. For example, long-term exposure to air pollution has been found to exacerbate the impacts of COVID-19 infections (Wu et al. 2020b), while urban areas with cleaner air from clean energy and greenspace, can provide advantages. </span></div><div style="" id="id17617"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17618">Some studies indicate that socio-economic factors, such as poverty, racial and ethnic disparities, and crowding are more significant than density in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality rate (Borjas 2020;  Maroko  et  al.  2020;  Lamb  et  al.  2021).  The  evidence  for  the  connection  between  household crowding  and  the  risk  of  contagion  from  infectious  diseases  is  also  strong.  A  2018  World  Health Organisation (WHO) systematic review of the effect of household crowding on health concluded that a majority of studies of the risk of non-tuberculosis infectious diseases, including flu-related illnesses, were associated with household crowding (Shannon et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id17626"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17627">Though  preliminary,  some  studies suggest  that  urban  areas  saw larger  overall  declines  in  emissions because of lower commuter activity and associated emissions.

While  this  may  be  temporary,  other  trends,  such  as  increased  rates  of teleworking and/or increased reliance on smart solutions that allow remote provision of services provide an unprecedented opportunity to transform urban travel patterns  (Belzunegui-Eraso and Erro-Garc&#233;s 2020; Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id17797"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17798">Related to the transport sector, the pandemic has resulted in concerns regarding the safety of public transport modes, which has resulted in significant reductions in public transport ridership in some cities  (Bucsky  2020;  de  Haas  et  al.  2020)  while  providing  opportunities  for  urban  transitions  in  others (Newman AO 2020). Considering the significance of public transportation for achieving low-carbon and inclusive urban development, appropriate response measures could enhance health safety of public transport modes  and  regain  public  trust  (Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir  2020). Similarly,  there is  a perceived  correlation  between  the  higher  densities  of  urban  living  and  the  risk  of  increased  virus transmission (Hamidi et al. 2020; Khavarian-Garmsir et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="" id="id17807"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17808">While city size could be a risk factor with higher transmission in larger cities (Hamidi et al. 2020; Stier et al. 2021), there is also evidence showing that density is not a major risk factor and indeed cities that are more compact have more capacity to respond to and control the pandemic  (Hamidi et al. 2020). Considering  the  spatial  pattern  of  density,  even  distribution  of  density  can  reduce  the  possibility  of crowding that is found to contribute to the scale and length of virus outbreak in cities.

However, like the basic accounting approach itself, standardization and practical deployment and scaling is an essential near-term need. </span></div></div></div><div class="pre_chapsec"><div style="" id="id7"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 13px;" id="id8">WG III contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report </span><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 12px;" id="id10">List of corrigenda to be implemented </span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 10px;" id="id12">The corrigenda listed below will be implemented in the Chapter during copy-editing. </span></div><div style="" id="id14"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 13px;" id="id15">CHAPTER 8 </span></div><div style="" id="id17"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 10px;" id="id18">Document (Chapter, Annex, Supp. Material) </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id24">Chapter 8 </span></div><div style="" id="id26"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 10px;" id="id27">Line </span></div><div style="" id="id29"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 10px;" id="id30">Detailed information on correction to make </span></div><div style="" id="id32"><span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold; font-size: 10px;" id="id33">Page (Based on the final pdf FGD version) </span></div><div style="" id="id39"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id40">41 </span></div><div style="" id="id42"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id43">16-20 </span></div><div style="" id="id45"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id46">Replace: However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and 2040, 12.5% of cropland in China and 7.5% of cropland in the Middle East and North Africa could be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017).  </span></div><div style="" id="id52"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id53">With </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id55">However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10px;" id="id57">2040, 12.5% of cropland in China and 7.5% of cropland in the Middle East and North Africa could potentially be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017). </span></div></div></div></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18089">
