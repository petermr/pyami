This growth outpaced the reduction in the use of energy per unit of GDP (-2% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1">, globally) as well as improvements in the carbon intensity of energy (-0.3%yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1">). {2.4.1, Figure 2.19}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The global COVID-19 pandemic led to a steep drop in CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emissions from fossil fuel and industry </b>(<i>high confidence</i>).

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A growing number of countries have achieved GHG emission reductions longer than 10 years – a few at rates that are broadly consistent with climate change mitigation scenarios that limit warming to well below 2°C </b><i>(high confidence)</i>. There are about 24 countries that have reduced CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> and GHG emissions for longer than 10 years. Reduction rates in a few countries have reached 4% in some years, in line with rates observed in pathways that <i>likely</i> limit warming to 2°C. However, the total reduction in annual GHG emissions of these countries is small (about 3.2 GtCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">eqyr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1">) compared to global emissions growth observed over the last decades. Complementary evidence suggests that countries have decoupled territorial CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions from Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but fewer have decoupled consumption-based emissions from GDP. This decoupling has mostly occurred in countries with high per capita GDP and high per capita CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions. {2.2.3, 2.3.3, Figure 2.11, Table 2.3, Table 2.4}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">FOOTNOTE </span><span class="s2">1</span><span class="s1"> Emissions of GHGs are weighed by Global Warming Potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) from the Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al., 2021). GWP-100 is commonly used in wide parts of the literature on climate change mitigation and is required for reporting emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). All metrics have limitations and uncertainties. (Cross-Chapter Box 2, Annex II, Part II, Section 8)<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Consumption-based CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emissions in developed countries and the Asia and Developing Pacific region are higher than in other regions </b>(<i>high confidence</i>). In developed countries, consumption-based CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions peaked at 15 GtCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> in 2007, declining to about 13 GtCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> in 2018. The Asia and Developing Pacific region, with 52% of current global population, has become a major contributor to consumption-based CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emission growth since 2000 (5.5% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1"> for 2000-2018); it exceeded the developed countries region, which accounts for 16% of current global population, as the largest emitter of consumption-based CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">. {2.3.2, Figure 2.14}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Carbon intensity improvements in the production of traded products have led to a net reduction in CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emissions embodied in international trade </b>(<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). A decrease in the carbon intensity of traded products has offset increased trade volumes between 2006 and 2016. Emissions embodied in internationally traded products depend on the composition of the global supply chain across sectors and countries and the respective carbon intensity of production processes (emissions per unit of economic output). {2.3, 2.4}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Developed countries tend to be net CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emission importers, whereas developing countries tend to be net emission exporters </b>(<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>).Net CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emission transfers from developing to developed countries via global supply chains have decreased between 2006 and 2016<b>. </b>Between 2004 and 2011, CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emission embodied in trade between developing countries have more than doubled (from 0.47 to 1.1 Gt) with the centre of trade activities shifting from Europe to Asia. {2.3.4, Figure 2.15}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Emissions from developing countries have continued to grow, starting from a low base of per capita emissions and with a lower contribution to cumulative emissions than developed countries </b><i>(robust evidence, high agreement)</i>. Average 2019 per capita CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">-FFI emissions in three developing regions - Africa (1.2 tCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">/cap), Asia and developing Pacific (4.4 tCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">/cap), and Latin America and Caribbean (2.7 tCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">/cap) - remained less than half that of developed countries (9.5 tCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">/cap) in 2019. CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">-FFI emissions in the three developing regions together grew by 26% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 260% between 1990 and 2010, while in Developed Countries emissions contracted by 9.9% between 2010-2019 and by 9.6% between 1990-2010. Historically, the three developing regions together contributed 28% to cumulative CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">-FFI emissions between 1850 and 2019, whereas Developed Countries contributed 57% and least developed countries contributed 0.4%. {2.2.3, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Globally, GHG emissions continued to rise across all sectors and subsectors; most rapidly in transport and industry (</b><i>high confidence</i><b>)</b>. In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO</span><span class="s3">2</span><span class="s1">eq) of global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO</span><span class="s3">2</span><span class="s1">eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO</span><span class="s3">2</span><span class="s1">eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO</span><span class="s3">2</span><span class="s1">eq) from transport and 5.6% (3.3 GtCO</span><span class="s3">2</span><span class="s1">eq) from buildings. Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered, the relative shares of industry and buildings emissions rise to 34% and 17%, respectively. Average annual GHG emissions growth during 2010-2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%, direct emissions only), but remained roughly constant at about 2% per year in the transport sector <i>(high<span ></span></i></span><span class="s1"><i>confidence)</i>. Emission growth in AFOLU is more uncertain due to the high share of CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">-LULUCF emissions. {2.4.2, Figure 2.13, Figures 2.16 to 2.21}.<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Average annual growth in GHG emissions from energy supply decreased from 2.3% for 2000–2009 to 1.0% for 2010–2019 </b><i>(high confidence)</i>. This slowing of growth is attributable to further improvements in energy efficiency (annually, 1.9% less energy per unit of GDP was used globally between 2010 and 2019). Reductions in global carbon intensity by -0.2% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1"> contributed further - reversing the trend during 2000-2009 (+0.2% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1">) (<i>medium confidence</i>). These carbon intensity improvement were driven by fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity particularly in Eastern Asia, and the increased use of renewables. {2.2.4, 2.4.2.1, Figure 2.17}<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>GHG emissions in the industry, buildings and transport sectors continue to grow, driven by an increase in the global demand for products and services</b> (<i>high confidence</i>). These final demand sectors make up 44% of global GHG emissions, or 66% when the emissions from electricity and heat production are reallocated as indirect emissions to related sectors, mainly to industry and buildings. Emissions are driven by the large rise in demand for basic materials and manufactured products, a global trend of increasing floor space per capita, building energy service use, travel distances, and vehicle size and weight. Between 2010-2019, domestic and international aviation were particularly fast growing at average annual rates of +3.3% and +3.4%. Global energy efficiencies have improved in all three demand sectors, but carbon intensities have not. {2.2.4; Figure 2.18; Figure 2.19; Figure 2.20}.<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Providing access to modern energy services universally would increase global GHG emissions by at most a few percent (<i>high confidence</i>). </b>The additional energy demand needed to support decent living standards</span><span class="s2">3</span><span class="s1"> for all is estimated to be well below current average energy consumption (<i>medium evidence, high agreement</i>). More equitable income distributions can reduce carbon emissions, but the nature of this relationship can vary by level of income and development (<i>limited evidence, medium agreement</i>). {2.4.3}<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Evidence of rapid energy transitions exists, but only at sub-global scales </b><i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i>. Emerging evidence since AR5 on past energy transitions identifies a growing number of cases of accelerated technology diffusion at sub-global scales and describes mechanisms by which future energy transitions may occur more quickly than those in the past. Important drivers include technology transfer and cooperation, intentional policy and financial support, and harnessing synergies among technologies within a sustainable energy system perspective <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i>. A fast global low-carbon energy transition enabled by finance to facilitate low-carbon technology adoption in developing and particularly in least developed countries can facilitate achieving climate stabilisation targets (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>).{2.5.2, Table 2.5}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Multiple low-carbon technologies have shown rapid progress since AR5 – in cost, performance, and adoption – enhancing the feasibility of rapid energy transitions</b> (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). The rapid deployment and cost decrease of modular technologies like solar, wind, and batteries have occurred much faster than anticipated by experts and modelled in previous mitigation scenarios (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). The political, economic, social, and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years. In contrast, the adoption of nuclear energy and CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> capture and storage in the electricity sector has been slower than the growth rates anticipated in stabilisation scenarios. Emerging evidence since AR5 indicates that small-scale technologies (e.g. solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more quickly than large-scale technologies (nuclear, CCS) <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement</i>). {2.5.3, 2.5.4, Figures 2.22 and 2.23}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Robust incentives for investment in innovation, especially incentives reinforced by national policy and international agreements, are central to accelerating low-carbon technological change</b><i>(robust evidence, medium agreement)</i>. Policies have driven innovation, including instruments for technology push (e.g., scientific training, R&amp;D) and demand pull (e.g., carbon pricing, adoption subsidies), as well as those promoting knowledge flows and especially technology transfer. The magnitude of the scale-up challenge elevates the importance of rapid technology development and adoption. This includes ensuring participation of developing countries in an enhanced global flow of knowledge, skills, experience, equipment, and technology itself requires strong financial, institutional, and capacity building support (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). {2.5.4, 2.5, 2.8}</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The global wealthiest 10% contribute about 36-45% of global GHG emissions </b><i>(robust evidence, high agreement)</i>. The global 10% wealthiest consumers live in all continents, with two thirds in high-income regions and one third in emerging economies <i>(robust evidence, medium agreement)</i>. The lifestyle consumption emissions of the middle income and poorest citizens in emerging economies are between 5-50 times below their counterparts in high-income countries <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i>. Increasing inequality within a country can exacerbate dilemmas of redistribution and social cohesion, and affect the willingness of rich and poor to accept lifestyle changes for mitigation and policies to protect the environment <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i> {2.6.1, 2.6.2, Figure 2.25}</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Estimates of future CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures already exceed remaining cumulative net CO</b></span><span class="s2"><b>2</b></span><span class="s1"><b> emissions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot </b>(<i>high confidence</i>)<b>. </b>Assuming variations in historic patterns of use and decommissioning, estimated future CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone are 660 (460-890) GtCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> and from existing and currently planned infrastructure 850 (600-1100) GtCO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1">. This compares to overall cumulative net CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions until reaching net zero CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> of 510 (330-710) Gt in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and 880 (640-1160) Gt in pathways that limit <i>likely</i> warming to 2°C (<i>high confidence</i>). While most future CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions from existing and currently planned fossil fuel infrastructure are situated in the power sector, most remaining fossil fuel CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions in pathways that limit likely warming to 2°C and below are from non-electric energy – most importantly from the industry and transportation sectors (<i>high confidence</i>). Decommissioning and reduced utilization of existing fossil fuel installations in the power sector as well as cancellation of new installations are required to align future CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions from the power sector with projections in these pathways (<i>high confidence</i>). {2.7.2, 2.7.3, Figure 2.26, Table 2.6, Table 2.7}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A broad range of climate policies, including instruments like carbon pricing, play an increasing role in GHG emissions reductions</b>. The literature is in broad agreement, but the magnitude of the reduction rate varies by the data and methodology used, country, and sector (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). Countries with a lower carbon pricing gap (higher carbon price) tend to be less carbon intensive (<i>medium confidence</i>). {2.8.2, 2.8.3}<span ></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Climate-related policies have also contributed to decreasing GHG emissions.</b> Policies such as taxes and subsidies for clean and public transportation, and renewable policies have reduced GHG emissions in some contexts (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). Pollution control policies and legislations that go beyond end-of-pipe controls have also had climate co-benefits, particularly if complementarities with GHG emissions are considered in policy design (<i>medium evidence, medium agreement</i>). Policies on agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and AFOLU sector-related policies such as afforestation policies can have important impacts on GHG emissions (<i>medium evidence, medium agreement</i>). {2.8.4}<span ></span></span></p>
