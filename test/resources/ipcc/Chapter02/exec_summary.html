Complementary evidence suggests that countries have decoupled territorial CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> emissions from Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but fewer have decoupled consumption-based emissions from GDP.

This slowing of growth is attributable to further improvements in energy efficiency (annually, 1.9% less energy per unit of GDP was used globally between 2010 and 2019). Reductions in global carbon intensity by -0.2% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1"> contributed further - reversing the trend during 2000-2009 (+0.2% yr</span><span class="s2">-1</span><span class="s1">) (<i>medium confidence</i>). These carbon intensity improvement were driven by fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity particularly in Eastern Asia, and the increased use of renewables. {2.2.4, 2.4.2.1, Figure 2.17}<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>GHG emissions in the industry, buildings and transport sectors continue to grow, driven by an increase in the global demand for products and services</b> (<i>high confidence</i>). These final demand sectors make up 44% of global GHG emissions, or 66% when the emissions from electricity and heat production are reallocated as indirect emissions to related sectors, mainly to industry and buildings. Emissions are driven by the large rise in demand for basic materials and manufactured products, a global trend of increasing floor space per capita, building energy service use, travel distances, and vehicle size and weight. Between 2010-2019, domestic and international aviation were particularly fast growing at average annual rates of +3.3% and +3.4%. Global energy efficiencies have improved in all three demand sectors, but carbon intensities have not. {2.2.4; Figure 2.18; Figure 2.19; Figure 2.20}.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Evidence of rapid energy transitions exists, but only at sub-global scales </b><i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i>. Emerging evidence since AR5 on past energy transitions identifies a growing number of cases of accelerated technology diffusion at sub-global scales and describes mechanisms by which future energy transitions may occur more quickly than those in the past. Important drivers include technology transfer and cooperation, intentional policy and financial support, and harnessing synergies among technologies within a sustainable energy system perspective <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement)</i>. A fast global low-carbon energy transition enabled by finance to facilitate low-carbon technology adoption in developing and particularly in least developed countries can facilitate achieving climate stabilisation targets (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>).{2.5.2, Table 2.5}<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Multiple low-carbon technologies have shown rapid progress since AR5 – in cost, performance, and adoption – enhancing the feasibility of rapid energy transitions</b> (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>).

The political, economic, social, and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years. In contrast, the adoption of nuclear energy and CO</span><span class="s2">2</span><span class="s1"> capture and storage in the electricity sector has been slower than the growth rates anticipated in stabilisation scenarios. Emerging evidence since AR5 indicates that small-scale technologies (e.g. solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more quickly than large-scale technologies (nuclear, CCS) <i>(medium evidence, medium agreement</i>). {2.5.3, 2.5.4, Figures 2.22 and 2.23}<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

Policies have driven innovation, including instruments for technology push (e.g., scientific training, R&amp;D) and demand pull (e.g., carbon pricing, adoption subsidies), as well as those promoting knowledge flows and especially technology transfer. The magnitude of the scale-up challenge elevates the importance of rapid technology development and adoption. This includes ensuring participation of developing countries in an enhanced global flow of knowledge, skills, experience, equipment, and technology itself requires strong financial, institutional, and capacity building support (<i>robust evidence, high agreement</i>). {2.5.4, 2.5, 2.8}</span></p>
