The global wealthiest 10% contribute about 36-45% of global GHG emissions (robust evidence, high agreement). The global 10% wealthiest consumers live in all continents, with two thirds in high-income regions and one third in emerging economies (robust evidence, medium agreement). The lifestyle consumption emissions of the middle income and poorest citizens in emerging economies are between 5-50 times below their counterparts in high-income countries (medium evidence, medium agreement). Increasing inequality within a country can exacerbate dilemmas of redistribution and social cohesion, and affect the willingness of rich and poor to accept lifestyle changes for mitigation and policies to protect the environment (medium evidence, medium agreement) {2.6.1, 2.6.2, Figure 2.25}
