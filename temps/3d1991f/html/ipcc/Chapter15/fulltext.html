This formulation is a recognition that the mitigation and resilience goals cannot be achieved without finance, both in the real economy and in the financial system, being made consistent with these goals (Zamarioli et al. 2021). It has in turn contributed to the development of the concept of alignment (with the Paris Agreement) used in the financial sector (banks, institutional investors), businesses, and public institutions (development banks, public budgets). As a result, since AR5, in addition to measuring and analysing climate finance, an increasing focus has been placed on assessing the consistency or alignment, as well as respectively the inconsistency or misalignment, of finance with climate policy objectives, as for instance illustrated by the multilateral development banks joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreements (MDBs 2018).  </span></div><div style="top: 17449px;" id="id3516" class="s100"><span id="id3517" class="s101">Assessing climate consistency or alignment implies looking at all investment and financing activities, whether they target, contribute to, undermine or have no particular impact on climate objectives.

Mitigation affects the scale of adaptation needs and adaptation may have strong synergies and co-benefits as well as trade-offs with mitigation (Grafakos et al. 2019). If mitigation investments are inadequate to reducing global warming  (as  in  last  decade)  with  asymmetric  adverse  impacts  in  lower  latitudes  and  low-lying geographies,  the  scale  of  adaptation  investments  has  to  rise  and  the  benefits  of  stronger  adaptation responses may be high (Markandya and González-Eguino 2019). If adaptation investments build greater resilience,  they  might  even  moderate  mitigation  financing  costs.  Similar  policy  coherence considerations apply to disaster risk reducing financing, the scale of which depends on success with both adaptation and mitigation (Mysiak et al. 2018). The same financial actors, especially governments and the private sector, decide at any given time on their relative allocations of available financing for mitigation, adaptation and disaster-risk from a constrained common pool of resources. The trade-offs and substitutability between closely-linked alternative uses of funds, therefore, make it essential for a simultaneous assessment of needs </span><span id="id3705" class="s101">–</span><span id="id3706" class="s101"> as in parts of this chapter. Climate finance versus the financing of other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) faces a similar issue. A key agreement was that climate </span><span id="id3709" class="s101">financing should be ‘new and additional’ and not at the cost of SDGs.</span><span id="id3710" class="s101"> Resources prioritising climate at the cost of non-climate development finance increases the vulnerability of a population for any given level of climate shocks, and additionality of climate financing is thus essential  (Brown et al. 2010). Policy coherence is also the reason why mitigation finance cannot be separated from consideration of spending and subsidies on fossil fuels. Climate change may additionally cause the breaching of physical and social adaptation limits, resulting in climate-related residual risks (i.e. potential impacts after all feasible mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction measures, have been implemented) (Mechler et al. 2020). Because these residual losses and damages from climate-related risks are related to overall mitigation and adaptation efforts, the magnitude of potential impacts are related to the overall quantum of  mitigation,  adaptation,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  finance  available  (Frame  et  al.  2020).  All categories of climate finance thus need to be considered together in discussions around climate finance. </span></div><div style="top: 18485px;" id="id3722" class="s100"><span id="id3723" class="s114">‘END BOX 15.</span><span id="id3724" class="s114">3 </span><span id="id3725" class="s114">HERE’</span></div><div style="top: 18507px;" id="id3728" class="s100"><span id="id3729" class="s101">The AR5 concluded that published assessments of financial flows whose expected effect was to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change aggregated 343-385 billion USD yr</span><span id="id3732" class="s20">-1 </span><span id="id3733" class="s101">globally between 2010 and 2012 (</span><span id="id3734" class="s111">medium confidence</span><span id="id3735" class="s101">).

In the context of policy coherence, it is also important to note that reported annual investments going into the fossil-fuel sectors, oil and gas upstream and coal mining, during the same period were about the same size as global climate finance, although the absence of  alternative financing and access to low carbon energy is a complicating factor. </span></div><div style="top: 19102px;" id="id3838" class="s100"><span id="id3839" class="s101">Adaptation financing needs, meanwhile, were rising rapidly.

Since  then, the financial  sector  has  recognised  the opportunity and has stepped up to centre-stage in the global policy conversation on climate change.

This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. However, this does not mean that finance necessarily plays an adequate enabling role for climate investments. On the contrary, the literature shows that without appropriate conditions, finance can represent a barrier to fill the climate investment gap (Hafner et al. 2020). Indeed, despite the enormous acceleration in policy initiatives (e.g. (NGFS 2020)) and coalitions of the willing in the private sectors, the effect in terms of closing the investment gap identified already in AR5 has been limited (see Section 15.5.2).</span></div><div style="top: 20173px;" id="id4132" class="s100"><span id="id4133" class="s101">Financial investors have started to account for  climate risk in some contexts but they do so only to a limited extent (Monasterolo and de Angelis 2020; Alessi et al. 2021; Bolton and Kacperczyk 2021) and the reasons for these remain unclear.

However, the standard treatment of risk both  in  financial  valuation  models  and  in  asset  pricing  assumes  that  risk  is  exogenous.  In  contrast, endogeneity is a key feature of climate risk because </span><span id="id4145" class="s101">today’s </span><span id="id4146" class="s101">perception of climate risk affects climate investment, which in turn affect directly the future risk.  This endogeneity leads to the fact that multiple and  rather  different  mitigation  scenarios  are  possible  (see  Chapter  3).  Moreover,  the  likelihood  of occurrence of each alternative scenario is very hard to estimate. Further, the assessment of climate-related financial risk requires to combine information related to mitigation scenarios as well as climate impact scenarios, leaving open an important knowledge gap for the next years (see Section 15.6.1).  </span></div><div style="top: 20372px;" id="id4153" class="s100"><span id="id4154" class="s101">The second aspect is that the multiplicity of equilibria results in a coordination problem whereby the </span><span id="id4156" class="s101">majority of investors wait to move and reallocate their investments until they can follow a clear signal.

Financial cycles typically have strong co-movements (asset prices, credit growth, interest rates, leverage, risk factors, market fear, macro-prudential and central bank policies) (Coeurdacier and Rey 2013), They have large consequences for all types of financial flows such as equity, bond and banking credit markets, which in turn are likely to impact climate finance flows to all sub-sectors and geographies (with greater expected volatility  in  more  risky  and  more  leveraged  regions).

In this respect, the impact of financial regulation is unclear.

Overall, these increments for climate finance remained, however, small in aggregate relative to the size of  the  shifts  in  climate  financing  required  in  the  coming  decade.  Annual  energy  investments  in developing regions (other than China) which account for two-thirds of the world population, with least costs of mitigation per ton of emissions (one-half that in developed regions), and for the bulk of future expected global GHG emissions, saw a 20 percent decline in investments since 2016, and only a one-fifth  share  of  global  clean  energy  investment,  reflecting  persistent  financing  problems  and  costs  of mobilizing finance towards clean energy transition, even prior to the pandemic  (IEA 2021a).

Paradoxically, while these effects should  have  raised  the  social  returns  and  incentives  to  invest  more  in  future  climate  mitigation,  a standard public policy argument, these macroeconomic shocks may work in the opposite direction for private decisions by raising the financing costs now (Cherif and Hasanov 2018). With some climate tipping points, potentially in the near-term reach (see Chapter 4: Future global climate: scenario-based 1 projections and near-term information in WGI) the uncertainty with regard to the economic viability and  growth  prospects  of  selected  macroeconomically  critical  sectors  increases  significantly  (see Chapter 8 and Chapter 17 in WGII). Taking account of other behavioural failures, this was creating a barrier for pro-active and accelerated mitigation and adaptation action. </span></div><div style="top: 21914px;" id="id4542" class="s100"><span id="id4543" class="s114">Public finances. </span><span id="id4544" class="s101">The second headwind was rising public fiscal costs of mitigation and adapting to rising climate  shocks  affecting  many  countries,  which  were  negatively  impacting  public  indebtedness  and country credit ratings (Cevik and Jalles 2020; Klusak et al. 2021) at a time of growing stresses on public finances and debt (Benali et al. 2018; Kling et al. 2018; Kose et al. 2020) (</span><span id="id4548" class="s111">high confidence</span><span id="id4549" class="s101">). Every climate shock and slowing growth puts greater pressures on public finances to offset these impacts.

As  a  result, the  standard  prescription  of  raising distributionally adverse carbon taxes and reducing fossil fuel subsidies to raise resources faced political pushback in several countries (Copland 2020; Green 2021), and low rates elsewhere.

The  positive  lesson is clear: opportunities  exist for  accelerating structural change, and for a re-orientation of economic activity modes to a low-carbon use strategy in areas such as coal use in energy consumption and surface transport, city congestion and in-country mobility, for which lower-cost alternatives exist and offer potentially dramatic gains (Hepburn et al. 2020b).  </span></div><div style="top: 23512px;" id="id4925" class="s100"><span id="id4926" class="s101">A new consensus and compact towards such a structural change and economic stimulus instruments may therefore need to be redrawn worldwide, where an accelerated low carbon transition is a priority; and  accelerated  climate  finance  to  spur  these  investments  may  gain  by  becoming  fully  and  rapidly integrated with near-term economic stimulus, growth and macroeconomic strategies for governments, central banks, and private financial systems alike.

The implications for a Just Transition in climate finance are clear: expanding equitable and greater access to climate finance for vulnerable countries, communities and </span><span id="id5119" class="s101">sectors, not just for the most profitable private investment opportunities, and a larger role for public finance in fulfilling existing finance commitments (Bracking and Leffel 2021; Kuhl 2021; Long 2021; Roberts et al. 2021) .  </span></div><div style="top: 25097px;" id="id5310" class="s100"><span id="id5311" class="s101">Large shocks, such as pandemics and slow-growing one such as climate are typically known to worsen inequality (IMF and World Bank 2020).

Additionally,  climate  policies  are  more politically difficult to implement, when the setting is one of high inequality but much less politically costly where incomes are more evenly distributed with stronger social safety nets (Furceri et al. 2021). A redrawn social compact incorporating climate (Beck et al. 2021) that would adopt redistributive taxes and lower carbon consumption, and strengthen state capacity to deliver safety nets, health, education with accelerated climate and environmental sustainability within and across countries is increasingly recognised as important. Countries, regions and coordination bodies of the larger countries (G-7, G-20) have  already  begun  such  as  shift  to  financing  of  a  Just  Transition,  but  primarily  focused  on  the developed countries, although gaps remain (Krawchenko and Gordon 2021).  </span></div><div style="top: 25269px;" id="id5326" class="s100"><span id="id5327" class="s101">Such a redrawing of a social compact has happened  significantly in the past, for example, after the </span><span id="id5329" class="s101">1860s ‘gilded age of capital’ with the enlargement of the franchise in democratization waves in Europe </span><span id="id5331" class="s101">and the Americas (Dasgupta and Ziblatt 2015, 2016). Not only was social conflict avoided but growth outcomes became more equitable and faster.  Similarly, comprehensive modern social safety nets and progressive taxation, which started in the Great Depression and was extended in the post-war period, had both a positive pro-growth and lower inequality effects (Brida et al. 2020) .  </span></div><div style="top: 25359px;" id="id5336" class="s100"><span id="id5337" class="s101">There are three levels of at which policy attention on climate financing now may need to be focused.

Because  private  investors  and  financing  mostly  deal  with  allocation  to climate  finance  at  a  global  portfolio  level,  then  to  allocation  by  countries,  and  finally  to  individual projects, the challenge for them is to refocus attention to Just Transition issues at the country level, but also globally as well as locally (in other words, at all three levels). </span></div><div style="top: 25476px;" id="id5346" class="s100"><span id="id5347" class="s101">Climate finance will likely face greater challenges in the post-pandemic context (Hanna et al. 2020; Henry et al. 2020).

It has also left  in  in  its  wake  divergent  prospects for  economic  recovery,  with  rising constraints  on  credit ratings  and  costly  debt  burden  in  many  developing  countries  contrasted  with  the  exceptionally  low interest  rate  settings  in  developed  economies  driving  the  limited  fiscal  space  in  the  former  groups (Benmelech  and  Tzur-Ilan  2020).

Shifting to a grant equivalent net flows definition of climate finance, which is now universally accepted for all other aid flows by all parties since 2014 and which took effect since 2019 on every other public international good finance provision (under the SDGs), with the sole exception of climate finance, would resolve many uncertainties: the disbursement of climate finance flows on a grant equivalent basis that is comparable across institutions, instruments and countries, and measurement with greater accuracy about the effective transfer of resources. The journey to get to a clear and precise definition of net Official Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) took time.

Private flows to accelerate the low-carbon transition  in  developing  countries  would  benefit  enormously,  by  gaining  clearer  access  to  public international funds and support defined on a grant equivalent basis, provided development and climate finance  operational  definitions  and  procedures  were  improved  on  an  urgent  basis  (Blended  Finance Taskforce 2018a; OECD-DAC 2021). When blended and supported by public finance and policy, the grant equivalency measure can easily and more accurately measure the value and benefit of blended public  and  private  finance  by  comparing  the  effective  interest  cost  (and  volume)  gain  with  such financing, against the benchmark costs without such blending. Here again, a pressing challenge is to improve the operational definitions of what counts as ODA within blended finance. Blended finance remains very poorly defined and accounted (Pereira 2017; Andersen et al. 2019; Attridge and Engen 2019; Basile and Dutra 2019). Guarantees are expressly not included in the definition of ODA (Garbacz et al. 2021), As a result, bilateral and multilateral agencies have no incentive or limited authority and basis to use such instruments, while multilateral development banks continue to approach guarantees with  great  caution  because  of  the  limits  of  their  original  charters  (World  Bank  2009)  and  require counter-indemnities by recipient countries, internal and historic agency inertia, perceived loss of control over the use of funds (compared to their preferred direct project-based lending) and employ restrictive accounting rules for capital provisioning of guarantees at 100% of their face value to maintain AAA </span><span id="id5548" class="s101">ratings with credit rating agencies (Humphrey 2017; Pereira dos Santos and Kearney 2018a; Bandura and Ramanujam 2019; Hourcade et al. 2021a). Largely because of such official uncertainty the actual flows of blended finance and guarantees continue to remain a very small share (typically, less than 5%) of official and multilateral finance flows to lower project risks and costs, and hence the potential for large-scale accelerated low-carbon private investments in developing countries. Public guarantees can offer  a  fifteen  times  multiplier  effect  on  the  scale  of  low-carbon  investments  generated  with  such support, compared to a 1:1 ratio in direct financing (Hourcade et al. 2021a). </span></div><div style="top: 26614px;" id="id5556" class="s100"><span id="id5557" class="s101">It makes sense to expedite these operational procedures (Khan et al. 2020) which cannot be otherwise explained except in terms of avoiding responsibilities, even where the benefits would be high (Klöck et </span><span id="id5560" class="s101">al. 2018).
