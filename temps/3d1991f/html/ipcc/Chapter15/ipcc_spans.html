While climate finance relates historically to the financial support of developed countries to developing countries, the Paris Agreement and its Article 2.1(c) has developed on a new narrative on that goes much beyond traditional flows  and  relates  to  all  sectors  and  actors.  Finance  flows  are  consistent  when  the  effects  are  either neutral  with  or  without  positive  climate  co-benefits  to  climate  objectives;  or  explicitly  targeted  on climate  benefits  in  adaptation  and/or  mitigation  result  areas.  Climate-related  financial  risk  is  still massively underestimated by financial institutions, financial decision-makers more generally and also </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21114">among public sector stakeholders limiting the sector’s potential of being an enabler of the trans</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21115">ition. The private sector has started to recognise climate-related risks and consequently redirect investment flows. Dynamics vary across sectors and regions with the financial sector being an enabler of transitions in  only  some  selected  (sub-)sectors  and  regions.  Consistent,  credible,  timely  and  forward-looking political leadership remains central to strengthen the financial sector as enabler. </span></div><div style="top: 90615px;" id="id21121"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21122">FAQ 15.2 What’s the current status of global climate finance and the alignment of global financial </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21124">flows with the Paris Agreement? </span></div><div style="top: 90648px;" id="id21126"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21127">There is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term 'climate finance' is applied to the financial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales,  including  international  financial  flows  to  developing  countries  to  assist  them  in  addressing climate change. Total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect aims to reduce net  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and/or  to  enhance  resilience  to  the  impacts  of  current  and projected climate change. This includes private and public funds, domestic and international flows and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21134">expenditures.  Tracking  of  climate  finance  flows  faces  limitations,  in  particular  for  national  climate finance flows.  </span></div><div style="top: 90758px;" id="id21137"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21138">Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. Annual global climate finance flows are on an upward trend since the fifth Assessment Report, according to CPI reaching more than 630 billion USD in 2019/2020, however, growth has likely slowed down and flows  remain  significantly  below  needs.  This  is  driven  by  barriers  within  and  outside  the  financial sector. More than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities despite the strong economic rationale of adaptation action.  Adjusting for higher estimates on current flows for energy efficiency based on IEA data, the dominance of mitigation becomes even stronger. Persistently high levels of both </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21146">public and private fossil-fuel related financing as well as other misaligned flows continue to be of major concern despite promising recent commitments. Significant progress has been made in the commercial finance sector with regard to the awareness of climate risks resulting from inadequate financial flows and climate action. However, a more consequent investment and policy decision making that enables a </span></div><div style="top: 91099px;" id="id21240"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21241">rapid redirection of financial flows is needed. Regulatory support as a catalyser is an essential convey of such redirections. Dynamics across sectors and regions vary with some being better positioned to close financing gaps and to benefit from an enabling role of finance in the short-term.  </span></div><div style="top: 91145px;" id="id21245"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21246">FAQ 15.3 What defines a financing gap, and where are the critically identified gaps?  </span></div><div style="top: 91166px;" id="id21248"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21249">A financing gap is defined as the difference between current flows and average needs to meet the long term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  Gaps  are  driven  by  various  barriers  inside  (short-termism, information gaps, home bias, limited visibility of future pipelines) and outside (e.g. missing pricing of externalities, missing regulatory frameworks) of the financial sector. Current mitigation financing flows come  in  significantly  below  average  needs  across  all  regions  and  sectors  despite  the  availability  of sufficient capital on a global basis. Globally, yearly climate finance flows have to increase by factor between 3 to 6 to meet average annual needs until 2030. </span></div><div style="top: 91262px;" id="id21257"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21258">Gaps  are  in  particular  concerning  for  many  developing  countries  with  COVID-19  exacerbating  the macroeconomic  outlook  and  fiscal  space  for  governments.  Also,  limited  institutional  capacity represents  a  key  barrier  for  many  developing  countries  burdening  risk  perceptions  and  access  to appropriately priced financing as well as limiting their ability to actively manage the transformation. Existing fundamental inequities in access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries exposure to physical impacts of climate change overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition. </span></div><div class="tree_root"><div style="top: 10839px;" id="id1904" marker="Chapter 15:"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;

Common frameworks, reporting transparency are, however, necessary in order to identify overlaps, commonalities and differences between these different measurements in terms of scope  and  underlying  definitions.

This formulation is a recognition that the mitigation and resilience goals cannot be achieved without finance, both in the real economy and in the financial system, being made consistent with these goals (Zamarioli et al. 2021). It has in turn contributed to the development of the concept of alignment (with the Paris Agreement) used in the financial sector (banks, institutional investors), businesses, and public institutions (development banks, public budgets). As a result, since AR5, in addition to measuring and analysing climate finance, an increasing focus has been placed on assessing the consistency or alignment, as well as respectively the inconsistency or misalignment, of finance with climate policy objectives, as for instance illustrated by the multilateral development banks joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreements (MDBs 2018).  </span></div><div style="top: 17449px;" id="id3516"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3517">Assessing climate consistency or alignment implies looking at all investment and financing activities, whether they target, contribute to, undermine or have no particular impact on climate objectives.

Mitigation affects the scale of adaptation needs and adaptation may have strong synergies and co-benefits as well as trade-offs with mitigation (Grafakos et al. 2019). If mitigation investments are inadequate to reducing global warming  (as  in  last  decade)  with  asymmetric  adverse  impacts  in  lower  latitudes  and  low-lying geographies,  the  scale  of  adaptation  investments  has  to  rise  and  the  benefits  of  stronger  adaptation responses may be high (Markandya and González-Eguino 2019). If adaptation investments build greater resilience,  they  might  even  moderate  mitigation  financing  costs.  Similar  policy  coherence considerations apply to disaster risk reducing financing, the scale of which depends on success with both adaptation and mitigation (Mysiak et al. 2018). The same financial actors, especially governments and the private sector, decide at any given time on their relative allocations of available financing for mitigation, adaptation and disaster-risk from a constrained common pool of resources.

Policy coherence is also the reason why mitigation finance cannot be separated from consideration of spending and subsidies on fossil fuels. Climate change may additionally cause the breaching of physical and social adaptation limits, resulting in climate-related residual risks (i.e. potential impacts after all feasible mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction measures, have been implemented) (Mechler et al. 2020). Because these residual losses and damages from climate-related risks are related to overall mitigation and adaptation efforts, the magnitude of potential impacts are related to the overall quantum of  mitigation,  adaptation,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  finance  available  (Frame  et  al.  2020).  All categories of climate finance thus need to be considered together in discussions around climate finance. </span></div><div style="top: 18485px;" id="id3722"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3723">‘END BOX 15.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3724">3 </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3725">HERE’</span></div><div style="top: 18507px;" id="id3728"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3729">The AR5 concluded that published assessments of financial flows whose expected effect was to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change aggregated 343-385 billion USD yr</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id3732">-1 </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3733">globally between 2010 and 2012 (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3734">medium confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id3735">).

This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. However, this does not mean that finance necessarily plays an adequate enabling role for climate investments. On the contrary, the literature shows that without appropriate conditions, finance can represent a barrier to fill the climate investment gap (Hafner et al. 2020). Indeed, despite the enormous acceleration in policy initiatives (e.g. (NGFS 2020)) and coalitions of the willing in the private sectors, the effect in terms of closing the investment gap identified already in AR5 has been limited (see Section 15.5.2).</span></div><div style="top: 20173px;" id="id4132"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4133">Financial investors have started to account for  climate risk in some contexts but they do so only to a limited extent (Monasterolo and de Angelis 2020; Alessi et al. 2021; Bolton and Kacperczyk 2021) and the reasons for these remain unclear.

This endogeneity leads to the fact that multiple and  rather  different  mitigation  scenarios  are  possible  (see  Chapter  3).  Moreover,  the  likelihood  of occurrence of each alternative scenario is very hard to estimate. Further, the assessment of climate-related financial risk requires to combine information related to mitigation scenarios as well as climate impact scenarios, leaving open an important knowledge gap for the next years (see Section 15.6.1).  </span></div><div style="top: 20372px;" id="id4153"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4154">The second aspect is that the multiplicity of equilibria results in a coordination problem whereby the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4156">majority of investors wait to move and reallocate their investments until they can follow a clear signal.

Paradoxically, while these effects should  have  raised  the  social  returns  and  incentives  to  invest  more  in  future  climate  mitigation,  a standard public policy argument, these macroeconomic shocks may work in the opposite direction for private decisions by raising the financing costs now (Cherif and Hasanov 2018). With some climate tipping points, potentially in the near-term reach (see Chapter 4: Future global climate: scenario-based 1 projections and near-term information in WGI) the uncertainty with regard to the economic viability and  growth  prospects  of  selected  macroeconomically  critical  sectors  increases  significantly  (see Chapter 8 and Chapter 17 in WGII).

Every climate shock and slowing growth puts greater pressures on public finances to offset these impacts. Crucially, the negative consequences were typically greater at the lower end of income distributions everywhere  (Acevedo  et  al.  2018;  Aggarwal  2019). As  a  result, the  standard  prescription  of  raising distributionally adverse carbon taxes and reducing fossil fuel subsidies to raise resources faced political pushback in several countries (Copland 2020; Green 2021), and low rates elsewhere. Reduced taxes on capital, by contrast, was viewed as a way to improve growth (Bhattarai et al. 2018; Font et al. 2018), </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4557">and  working  against  broader fiscal  action.

They are causing divergent impacts across sectors and countries, which combined with the divergent ability of countries and regions to mount sufficient fiscal and monetary policy actions imply continued high uncertainty on the economic recovery paths from the crisis. The situation remains more precarious in middle and low-income developing countries (IMF 2021a). While recovery is happening, the job losses have been large, poverty rates have climbed, public health systems are suffering long-term consequences, education gains have been set back, public debt levels are higher (5-10% of GDP higher), financial institutions have come under longer-term stress, a larger number of developing countries are facing debt distress, and many key high-contact sectors such  as  tourism  and  trade  will  take  time  to  recover  (Eichengreen  et  al.  2021).    The  implication  is negative headwinds for climate finance with public attention focused on pandemic relief and recovery and limited (and divergent) fiscal headroom for a low carbon transition, with considerable uncertainties ahead (Hepburn et al. 2020b; Maffettone and Oldani 2020; Steffen et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="top: 22862px;" id="id4751"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4752">The larger and still open public policy choice question that COVID-19 now raises is whether there is room for public policy globally and in respect of their individual economies to integrate climate more centrally to  their  growth,  jobs  and  sustainable  development  strategies  worldwide  for  ecological  and economic survival.

Moreover,  longer-term behavioural  impacts  are  also  possible:  a  dramatic  acceleration  of  digital  technologies  in communications, travel, retail trade and transport. The question however is whether the world might revert to the earlier carbon-intensive path of recovery, or to a different future, and the choice of policies in shaping this future. Studies generally suggest that the gains from long-term impacts of the pandemic on future global warming will be limited and depend more on the nature of public policy actions and long-term commitments by countries to raise their ambitions, not just on climate but on sustainable development broadly (Barbier 2020; Barbier and Burgess 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Gillingham et al. 2020;  Reilly  et  al. 2021). The  positive  lesson is clear: opportunities  exist for  accelerating structural change, and for a re-orientation of economic activity modes to a low-carbon use strategy in areas such as coal use in energy consumption and surface transport, city congestion and in-country mobility, for which lower-cost alternatives exist and offer potentially dramatic gains (Hepburn et al. 2020b).  </span></div><div style="top: 23512px;" id="id4925"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id4926">A new consensus and compact towards such a structural change and economic stimulus instruments may therefore need to be redrawn worldwide, where an accelerated low carbon transition is a priority; and  accelerated  climate  finance  to  spur  these  investments  may  gain  by  becoming  fully  and  rapidly integrated with near-term economic stimulus, growth and macroeconomic strategies for governments, central banks, and private financial systems alike.

Additionally,  climate  policies  are  more politically difficult to implement, when the setting is one of high inequality but much less politically costly where incomes are more evenly distributed with stronger social safety nets (Furceri et al. 2021). A redrawn social compact incorporating climate (Beck et al. 2021) that would adopt redistributive taxes and lower carbon consumption, and strengthen state capacity to deliver safety nets, health, education with accelerated climate and environmental sustainability within and across countries is increasingly recognised as important. Countries, regions and coordination bodies of the larger countries (G-7, G-20) have  already  begun  such  as  shift  to  financing  of  a  Just  Transition,  but  primarily  focused  on  the developed countries, although gaps remain (Krawchenko and Gordon 2021).  </span></div><div style="top: 25269px;" id="id5326"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5327">Such a redrawing of a social compact has happened  significantly in the past, for example, after the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5329">1860s ‘gilded age of capital’ with the enlargement of the franchise in democratization waves in Europe </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5331">and the Americas (Dasgupta and Ziblatt 2015, 2016). Not only was social conflict avoided but growth outcomes became more equitable and faster.

Private flows to accelerate the low-carbon transition  in  developing  countries  would  benefit  enormously,  by  gaining  clearer  access  to  public international funds and support defined on a grant equivalent basis, provided development and climate finance  operational  definitions  and  procedures  were  improved  on  an  urgent  basis  (Blended  Finance Taskforce 2018a; OECD-DAC 2021). When blended and supported by public finance and policy, the grant equivalency measure can easily and more accurately measure the value and benefit of blended public  and  private  finance  by  comparing  the  effective  interest  cost  (and  volume)  gain  with  such financing, against the benchmark costs without such blending. Here again, a pressing challenge is to improve the operational definitions of what counts as ODA within blended finance. Blended finance remains very poorly defined and accounted (Pereira 2017; Andersen et al. 2019; Attridge and Engen 2019; Basile and Dutra 2019). Guarantees are expressly not included in the definition of ODA (Garbacz et al. 2021), As a result, bilateral and multilateral agencies have no incentive or limited authority and basis to use such instruments, while multilateral development banks continue to approach guarantees with  great  caution  because  of  the  limits  of  their  original  charters  (World  Bank  2009)  and  require counter-indemnities by recipient countries, internal and historic agency inertia, perceived loss of control over the use of funds (compared to their preferred direct project-based lending) and employ restrictive accounting rules for capital provisioning of guarantees at 100% of their face value to maintain AAA </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5548">ratings with credit rating agencies (Humphrey 2017; Pereira dos Santos and Kearney 2018a; Bandura and Ramanujam 2019; Hourcade et al. 2021a). Largely because of such official uncertainty the actual flows of blended finance and guarantees continue to remain a very small share (typically, less than 5%) of official and multilateral finance flows to lower project risks and costs, and hence the potential for large-scale accelerated low-carbon private investments in developing countries. Public guarantees can offer  a  fifteen  times  multiplier  effect  on  the  scale  of  low-carbon  investments  generated  with  such support, compared to a 1:1 ratio in direct financing (Hourcade et al. 2021a). </span></div><div style="top: 26614px;" id="id5556"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5557">It makes sense to expedite these operational procedures (Khan et al. 2020) which cannot be otherwise explained except in terms of avoiding responsibilities, even where the benefits would be high (Klöck et </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5560">al. 2018).

But  this  would  nevertheless  require  a  carefully  managed  transition  globally, including access to much larger volumes of climate financing in developing economies (Muttitt and Kartha 2020). The multilateral finance institutions have generally played a supportive role, expanding their financing to developing countries during the pandemic (even as bilateral aid flows have fallen sharply), but have been hampered by the of constraints on their mandates and instruments (as noted earlier).  Political  leadership  and  direction  will  be  again  crucial  to  enhance  their  roles.  The  recent expansion of SDR quotas at the IMF similarly might help, but the current distributions of quota benefits flow primarily to the developed countries and does little to expand investment flows on a longer-term basis for a global expansion in growth and job opportunities in the low-carbon transition.  </span></div><div style="top: 27211px;" id="id5713"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id5714">As a fifth priority, transformative climate financing options based on equity and global sustainability objectives  may  also  need  to  consider  a  greater  mix  of  public  pricing  and  taxation  options  on  the consumption side (Arrow et al. 2004; Folke et al. 2021).

Only  national  governments  have  ability  to  borrow more  in  their  fiscal accounts to address large collective problems, whether pandemics or climate change. Therefore, it is important that national policies and funds be available for programs to address the Just Transition issues for  larger  sub-national  states,  cities  and  regions.

However, private investments in  climate  projects  and  activities  often  benefit  from  public  support  in  the  form  of  co-financing, guarantees or fiscal measures.

While capacity additions on the ground kept rising, falling technology costs in certain sectors (e.g. solar energy) has had a negative impact on the year-on-year trend that can be observed in terms of volumes of climate finance (IRENA 2019a; BNEF 2019). However, such cost reduction could free up investment and financing capacities for potential use in other climate-related activities.  </span></div><div style="top: 31678px;" id="id7413"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7414">Tracking  adaptation  finance  continues  to  pose  significant  challenges  in  terms  of  data  and  methods. Notably, the mainstreaming of resilience into investments and business decisions makes it difficult to identify relevant activities within financial datasets (Agrawala et al. 2011; Averchenkova et al. 2016)  (Brown  et  al.  2015).  Despite  these  limitations,  evidence  shows  that  finance  for  adaptation  remains fragmented and significantly below rapidly rising needs (Section 15.4 and WG2, TSU please confirm). Further, there is increasing awareness about the need to better understand and address the interlinkages between  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster-risk-reduction  (DRR)  towards  achieving  resilience (OECD 2020a). (Watson et al. 2015) however, notes that between 2003 and 2014 of the 2 billion USD that flowed through dedicated climate change adaptation funds, only 369 million USD explicitly went to DRR activities (Climate Funds Update 2014; Nakhooda et al. 2014a,b; Watson et al. 2015).

A consensus, however, exists, on a need to further scale up public finance and improve its effectiveness in mobilising private finance (OECD 2020b), as well as to further prioritise adaptation financing, in particular towards the most vulnerable countries (Carty et al.  2020). The relatively low share of adaptation in international climate finance to date may in part due to a low level of obligation and precision in global adaptation rules and commitments  (Hall  and  Persson  2018).  Further,  providers  of international  climate finance may have more incentive to support mitigation over adaptation as mitigation benefits are global while the benefits of adaptation are local or regional (Abadie et al. 2013).  </span></div><div style="top: 32502px;" id="id7613"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7615">‘START BOX 15.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7616">4 </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7617">HERE’</span></div><div style="top: 32523px;" id="id7620"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7621">Box 15.4 Measuring progress towards the 100 billion USD </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7622">yr</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id7623">-1 </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7624">by 2020 goal - issues of method </span></div><div style="top: 32545px;" id="id7626"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7627">In  2009,  at  COP15,  Parties  to  the  UNFCCC  agreed  the  following:  “In  the  context  of  meaningful </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7629">mitigation  actions  and  transparency  on  implementation,  developed  countries  commit  to  a  goal  of mobilizing jointly 100 billion USD dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.

This inconsistency exposes investors and asset owners to the risk of stranded assets, which results from potential sharp strengthening climate public policies, i.e. transition risk. As a result, a growing number of investors and financiers are assessing climate-related risks with the aim to disclose information about their current level of exposure (to both transition and physical climate-related risks), as well as to inform their future decisions (TCFD 2017).

Such lack of coherence includes low pricing of carbon and of environmental externalities more generally, as well as misaligned policies in non-climate policy areas such as fiscal, trade, industrial and investment policy, and financial regulation (OECD 2015b), as further specified in the sectoral Chapters 6 to 12.  </span></div><div style="top: 34663px;" id="id8049"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8050">The most documented policy misalignment relates to the remaining very large scale of public direct and indirect financial support for fossil fuel-related production and consumption in many parts of the world (Bast et al. 2015; Coady et al. 2017; Climate Transparency 2020).

Such trend is due to slowed down progress in reducing support among OECD and G20 economies in 2017 (OECD 2018b) and to a rise in fossil-fuel subsidies for consumption in several developing economies (Matsumura and Adam 2019), which, in turn, reduces the efficiency of public instruments and incentives aimed at redirecting investments and financing towards low-GHG activities.  </span></div><div style="top: 35039px;" id="id8126"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8127">As a result, the demand for fossil fuels, especially in the energy production, transport and buildings sectors, remain high, and the risk-return profile of fossil fuel-related investments it still positive in many instance (Hanif et al. 2019).

Also, financing needs are used as an indicator for required system changes (when compared to current flows and asset bases) and an indicator for near- to long-term investment opportunities from the perspective of investors and corporates. Investment needs are widely used as an indicator focusing on initial investments required to realise new infrastructure. It compares relatively well with private sector flows  dominated  by  return-generating  investments  but  lacks  comparability  and  explanatory  power regarding  the  needs  in  the  context  of  international  climate  cooperation  where  considerations  on economic costs play a more substantial role. Chapter 12 elaborates on global economic cost estimates for  various  technologies.  This  indicator  includes  both  costs  and  benefits  of  options,  of  which investment-related costs make up only one component. . Both analyses offer complementary insights. There are financing needs not directly related to the realisation of physical infrastructure and which are not  covered  in  both,  investment  and  cost estimates.  For  instance, the  need  for  building institutional capacity facilitating to achieve social and economic goals underpinning knowledge, skills, notional and international cooperation might not be significant, but an enabling environment for future investments would not be established without satisfying it. Moreover, comprehending financial needs for addressing economic losses due to climate change can hardly be measured in terms of the indicators introduced before. </span></div><div style="top: 35429px;" id="id8162"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8163">Understanding the magnitude of the challenge to scale-up finance in sectors and regions requires a more comprehensive  (and  qualitative)  assessment  of  the  needs.

Some essential elements  are  the  duration  of  loan  and  profile  as  long  term  loans  and  heavily  heterogeneous  returns represent challenges in financing mitigation technologies and policies. After the financial crisis and restricted access to long-term debt, capital intensity of technologies and resulting long payback periods of investment opportunities for mitigation technologies have been a crucial challenge  (Bertoldi et al. 2021). Also, implicit discount rates applied during the investment decision process vary depending on the  payback  profile,  with  research  mainly  covering  the  difference  between  the  financing  of  assets generating revenues versus costs (Jaffe et al. 2004; Schleich et al. 2016). In addition, a low correlation between  the  climate  projects  and  dominating  asset  classes  might  provide  an  opportunity  in  climate action  by  satisfying  the  appetite  of  institutional  investors,  which  tend  to  manage  portfolios  with consideration  of  the  Markowitz  modern  portfolio  theory  (optimizing  return  and  risk  of  a  portfolio through diversification) (Marinoni et al. 2011). Transaction cost is a significant barrier to the diffusion and commercialization of low-carbon technologies and business models and adaptation action. High transaction  costs,  attributed  to  various  factors,  such  as  complexity  and  limited  standardisation  of investments, limited pipelines, complex institutional and administrative procedures, create significant opportunity  costs  of  green  investments  comparing  with  other  standard  investments  (IRENA  2016; Nelson et al. 2016; Feldman et al. 2018). For example, transaction costs are commonly observed in small-scale,  dispersed  independent  renewable  energy  systems,  especially  in  rural  areas,  and  energy efficiency  projects  (Hunecke  et  al.  2019).  A  more  robust  standardisation  and  alignment  of  Power Purchase  Agreement  (PPA)  terms  with  best  practices  globally  has  led  to  a  substantially  increased interest in capital markets in developing countries (WBCSD 2016; Schmidt et al. 2019; World Bank 2021).  Notably,  Power  Purchase  Agreement  (PPA)  significantly  increases  the  probability  of  more balanced investment and development outcomes and ultimately more  sustainable independent power projects in developing countries.

The falling technology costs and the competitiveness of renewable technologies, especially solar PV and wind, have accelerated the deployment of renewable technologies over the past years. renewable energy technologies now often competitive, even become the cheapest, in many countries, even without financial support, (FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2015, 2016,  2017,  2018,  2019;  IEA  2020c;  IRENA  2020a)  and  without  pricing  of  the  avoided  carbon emissions. In contrast, the dependency on regulatory interventions and public financial support to create financial viability has provided a source of volatile investor appetite. The annual volume of renewable investment by country is often volatile reflecting ending and new regulations and policies (IEA 2019a).  </span></div><div style="top: 36321px;" id="id8408"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8409">For example, the recent Chinese policy direction towards tougher access to and a substantial cut in FiT in 2018 led to a significant drop in renewable investment and new capacity addition in China (FS-UNEP Centre  and  BNEF  2019;  Hove  2020).  However,  the  significant  bouncing  back  of  newly  installed capacity (72 GW wind power and 47 GW solar power in 2020) shows the strong development of zero carbon  power  generation  driven  by  lower  cost  and  policies  to  support  them  by  energy  revolution strategies in China.

However, the collapse of carbon markets and prices, especially of the EU ETS, led to the continuous decline of Certified Emission Reductions (CER) issuances from CDM in the past years (World Bank Group 2020). Also, the dependency on regulatory intervention to ensure fair market access only has proven to burden investor appetite.  </span></div><div style="top: 36692px;" id="id8543"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8544">A significant share of investment needs in heavily regulated sectors, such as electricity, public transport, and  telecom,  emphasises  the  importance  of  regulatory  intervention,  such  as  ownership  and  market access  (OECD  2017b).  For  instance,  energy-system  developments  require  effective  and  credible commitments and action by policy-maker to ensure an efficient capital allocation aligned with climate targets (Bertram et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="top: 36768px;" id="id8550"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8551">There are a lot of discussion about the regulated ownership of the private sector (European Commission 2017)  and  the  restructuring  of  electricity  market  contributed  to  low  level  of  investment  in  baseline electricity  capacity  and  in  investment  research  and  innovation.  This  changes  create  uncertainty  of investment, and barriers to market entry and exit also potentially limit the competition in the market and restrict the entrance of new investment (Finon 2006; Joskow 2007; Grubb and Newbery 2018).

First movers realised these projects with investors and developers acting  from  conviction  (Steffen  et  al.  2018).  Such  action  is  not  possible  to  this  extent  in  energy efficiency with related investment rather representing an add-on component and consequently requiring the  support  of  decision-makers  used  to  business-as-usual  projects.  Despite  the  benefits  that improvement  of  energy  efficiency  has  in  contributing  to  curbing  energy  consumption,  mitigating greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  providing  multiple  co-benefits  (IEA  2014a),  investment  in  energy efficiency is at a low priority for firms, and the financial environment is not favourable due to lacking awareness  of  energy  efficiency  by  financial  institutions,  existing  administrative  barriers,  lack  of expertise to develop projects, asymmetric information, and split incentives (UNEP DTU 2017; Cattaneo 2019).  While  Energy  Service  Companies  (ESCO)  business  models  are  expected  to  facilitate  the investment in energy efficiency by sharing a portion of financial risk and providing expertise, there has been limited progress made with ESCO business models, and only slightly over 20% of projects used financing through ESCOs (UNEP DTU 2017). </span></div><div style="top: 37057px;" id="id8575"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8576">The investment needs and existing challenges differ by sector. Each sector has different characteristics along the arguments listed above making the supply of finance by commercial investors an enabling factor  or  barrier.  In  the  transport  sector,  transformation  towards  green  mobility  would  provide significant  co-benefits  for  human  health  by reducing  transport-related  air  pollution,  so  the  transport sector  cannot  achieve  such  transformation  in  isolation  with  other  sectors.  However,  a  considerable involvement of the public sector in many transportation infrastructure projects is given, and the absence of a standard solution increases transaction costs (including bidding package, estimating, drawing up a contract, administering the contract, corruption, and so on). Financial constraints, including access to adequate  finance,  pose  a  significant  challenge  in  the  agriculture  sector,  especially  for  SMEs  and smallholder farmers. The distortion created by government failure and a lack of effective policies create barriers to financing for agriculture. The inability to manage the impact of the agriculture-related risks, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8588">such  as  seasonality, increases  uncertainty  in  financial  management.  Moreover,  inadequate infrastructure, such as electricity and telecommunication, makes it difficult for financial institutions to reach  agricultural  SMEs  and  farmers  and  increases  transaction  costs  (World  Bank  2016).  Low economies of scale, low bargaining power, poor connectivity to markets, and information asymmetry also lead to higher transaction cost (Pingali et al. 2019). In the industrial manufacturing and residential sector, gaining energy efficiency remains one of the critical challenges. Investment in achieving energy efficiency encounters some challenges when it may not necessarily generate direct or indirect benefits, such as increase in production capacity or productivity and improvement in product quality. Also, early-stage,  high  upfront  cost  and  future,  stable  revenue  stream  structure  suggest  the  needs  for  a  better enabling  environment,  such  as  a  robust  financial  market,  awareness  of  financial  institutions,  and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8600">regulatory frameworks (e.g., stringent building codes, incentives for ESCOs) (IEA 2014a; Barnsley et al. 2015). </span></div><div style="top: 37605px;" id="id8724"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id8725">15.4.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id8727">Quantitative assessment of financing needs </span></div><div style="top: 37628px;" id="id8729"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8730">Multiple stakeholders prepare and present quantitative financing needs assessments with methodologies applied to vary significantly representing a major challenge for aggregation of needs (i.e. (Osama et al. 2021) for African countries), most of them with a focus on scenarios likely to limit warming to 2°C or lower. The differences relate to the scope of the assessments  regarding sectors, regions and periods, top-down  versus  bottom-up  approaches,  and  methodological  issues  around  boundaries  of  climate-related  investment  needs,  particularly  full  vs  incremental  costs  and  the  exclusion  or  inclusion  of consumer-level investments.

The financial and economic circumstances are the opposite for virtually all developing countries, even within a heterogeneity of circumstances across countries. The dilemma, however, is that the fastest rates  of  the  expected  increase  in  future  carbon  emissions  are  in  developing  countries.  The  biggest challenge of climate finance globally is thus likely to be the constraints to climate financing because of the opportunity costs and relative under-development of capital markets and financing constraints (and costs) at home in developing countries, and the relative availability or absence of adequate financing policy  support  internationally  from  developed  countries.  The  Paris  Agreement  and  commitment  by developed countries to support the climate financing needs of developing countries thus continue to matter a great deal.  </span></div><div style="top: 48459px;" id="id11971"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11972">Soft  costs  /  Institutional  capacity  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11973">(Osama  et  al.  2021).  Most  funding  needs  assessments  focus  on technology  costs  and  ignore  the  cascade  of  financing  needs  as  outlined  above.  International  grant funding or national budget allocations for soft costs like the creation of a regulatory environment can be prerequisite for the supply of commercial financing for the deployment of technologies. Such critical funding needs might represent a small share of overall investment needs but current (relatively small) gaps in funding of policy reforms can hinder/delay deployment of large volumes of funding in later years. The role, as well as the approximate volumes of such required timely international grant funding or  national  budget  allocations,  appear  underestimated  in  research.  The  numbers  available  for  the creation of an enabling environment for medium-sized RE projects in Uganda (GET FiT Uganda) are illustrative only and cannot be transferred as assumptions to other countries without taking into account potentially varying starting points in terms of institutional readiness, pipelines as well as the general business environment. GET FiT Uganda supported 170 MWp of medium-scale RE capacity triggering investments of 453 million USD (GET FiT Uganda 2018), international results-based incremental cost support  amounted  to  92  million  USD  and  project  preparation,  technical  assistance,  as  well  as implementation support, required 8 million USD excluding support from national agencies.  </span></div><div style="top: 48672px;" id="id11989"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id11990">There is strong evidence of the correlation between institutional capacity of countries and international climate finance flows towards those economies (Adenle et al. 2017; Stender et al. 2019) and a strong need for robust institutional capacity to manage the transformation in a sustainable and human rights based way (Duyck et al. 2018). One example to consider unaddressed social concerns, is the ongoing call for feedback by the European Commission and its platform on sustainable finance. It  argues for a social taxonomy, that can support the identification of financing opportunities of economic activities contributing to social objectives (European Commission 2021b). SEforAll has highlighted the issue of investments not going to the countries with the greatest need, also partly driven by institutional capacity levels (SEforALL and CPI 2020). Also, most of the developing countries NDCs are conditional upon international  support  for capacity  building  (Pauw  et al.  2020).

Initial  evaluations  of  the  mechanism underpin its importance and value for developing countries but stress long lead times and predictability of  future  international  public  funding  to  maintain  operations  as  key  challenges  (UNFCCC  2017; DANIDA 2018). While limited pipelines, limited absorptive capacities as well as restricted institutional capacity of countries being often stated as challenge for an accelerated deployment of funding (Adenle et al. 2017), the question remains on the role of international public climate finance to address this gap and whether a concrete current financing gap exists for patient institutional capacity building. While </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12010">current short-term, mostly project-related capacity building often fails to meet needs but alternative, well-structured patient interventions and funding could play an important role (Saldanha 2006; Hope 2011) accepting other barriers than funding playing a role as well. One reason why international public climate  funding  is  not  sufficiently  directed  to  such  needs  might  be  the  complexity  in  measuring intangible, direct outcomes like improved institutional capacity (Clark et al. 2018).  </span></div><div style="top: 49179px;" id="id12126"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12127">Early  stage/Venture  capital  funding/Pilot  project  funding  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12128">Early-stage  companies  in  impact investment sectors with business solutions can contribute positively to climate impact. Figure SPM.8 highlights the need for new business models facilitating parts of the behavioural change. Also, SE4All has underpinned the need for an expansion of available business models to achieve universal access (SEforALL and CPI 2020). Further research and development needs range from resource efficiency of proven  technologies  and  next  generation  technologies  but  also  new  technologies  (see  Chapter  16).  Access to early stage funding remains critical with performance in in recent years being weak (Gaddy et al. 2016). This historically weak performance of clean tech start-ups burdens the interest of investors in  the  sector  on  the  one  hand  and  discourage  experienced  executive  talent  (Wang  and  Yee  2020). Besides that, the concentration of VC markets in the US, Europe and India represents a major challenge (FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2019; Statistica 2021).

For example, for their transforming energy scenario IRENA estimates the number of EVs to increase from around 8m units in 2019 to 269m units in 2030 (IRENA 2020c). This would require investments in battery factories amounting to approximately 207 USD billion with further investment  requirements  in  the  value  chain  (IRENA  2020d).  This  illustrates  the  extent  of  parallel investments based on goals rather than concrete regulatory interventions and/or demand and poses a problem of up-front investment risks for each industry in the chain in the absence of certainty of the presence  of  parallel  decisions  in  the  upstream  and  downstream  links  in  the  chain.

Challenges  related  to  financing  residual  climate-related  losses  and  damages  are particularly high for developing countries. Financing losses and damages from extreme events requires rapid  pay-outs;  the  cost  of  financing  for  many  developing  countries  is  already  quite  high;  and  the expense of risk financing is expected to increase as disasters become more frequent, intense and more costly not only due to climate change but also due to higher levels of exposure. Addressing both extreme and slow onset climate impacts requires designing adequate financial protection systems for reaching the most vulnerable. Moreover, some fraction of losses and damages, both material and non-material, are not commonly valued in monetary terms [non-economic loss] and hence financing requirements are hard  to  estimate.

This implies changes in incentives of the supervised financial actors, both public and private, and thus changes in the landscape of mitigation action by generating a new potential for climate finance flows. However, critical knowledge gaps remain. In particular, the underestimation of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12681">climate-related  financial  risk  by  public  and  private  financial  actors  c an   ex pl ai n  that the current </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12683">allocation  of  capital among financial institutions is often inconsistent with the mitigation objectives (Rempel et al. 2020). Moreover, even a correct assessment of risk, which could provide incentives for divesting from carbon-intensive activities, does not necessarily lead to investing in the technical options needed for deep decarbonisation. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the low carbon transition require to fill in at the same time gaps about risk and gaps about investments in enabling activities in a broader sense.  </span></div><div style="top: 52227px;" id="id12690"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12691">impacts  especially </span></div><div style="top: 52213px;" id="id12693"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12694">Physical risk. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12695">On the one hand, unmitigated climate change implies an increased potential for adverse socio-economic in  more  exposed  economic  activities  and  areas  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12698">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12700">.

In  turn,  these losses can translate into losses on the values of financial assets issued by exposed companies (e.g., equity/bonds) and or sovereign entities as well as losses for insurance companies. The assessment of climate financial physical risks poses both challenges  in  terms  of  data,  methods  and  scenarios.  It  requires  to  cross-match  scenarios  of climate-related  hazards  at  granular  geographical  scale,  with  the  geolocation  and financial  value  of  physical assets.

Note the impact could be unanticipated even if the date of the introduction is known in advance by the market players. There are several reasons why such adjustments could occur. One simple argument is that the political  economy of the transition is characterised by  forces  in  different  directions,  including  opposing  interests  within  the  industry, mounting  pressure  from  social  awareness  of  unmitigated  climate  risks.  Politics  will  have  to  find  a synthesis and the outcome could remain uncertain until it suddenly unravels. Note also that, in order to be relevant for financial risk, the disorderly transition does not need to be a catastrophic scenario in terms of the fabric of markets. It also does not automatically entail systemic risk, as discussed further down. Knowledge gaps in this area are related to emerging questions, including: What are, in detail, the transmission channels of physical and transition risk?

How do transition risk and opportunities depend on the future scenarios of climate change and climate policies? How to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty around the scenarios? To what extent, an underestimation of climate-related financial risk, could feed back on the alignment of climate finance flows and hamper the low-carbon transition?  Should  climate  risk  be  explicitly  accounted  for  in  regulatory  frameworks  for financial  institutions,  such  as  Basel  III  for  banks  and  national  frameworks  for  insurance?

Further assessments of physical risk for financial assets (Mandel 2020), accounting in particular for  the  propagation  of  losses  through  financial  networks,  estimate global yearly GDP losses at 7.1% (1.13%) in 2080, without adaptation (with adaptation), the former corresponding to a 10-fold increase with respect  to  the current yearly losses  (0.76%  of  global  GDP).

The indirect costs of climate-related flooding event can be up to 50% of the total costs, the majority of which is not covered by insurance (Alnes et  al.  2018)  (see  chapter  15.6.4).

This suggests that only less than the whole quantity of fossil fuels currently valued (either currently extracted, waiting for extraction as reserves or assets on company balance sheets) can yield economic return if the carbon budget is respected. The devaluation of fossil fuel assets imply financial losses for both the public sector (see Section 15.6.8) and the private sector (Coffin and Grant 2019). Global estimates of potential stranded fossil fuel assets amount to at least  1 trillion, based on  ongoing  low-carbon  technology  trends  and  in  the absence  of climate policies  (cumulated  to  2035  with  10%  discount  rate  applied;  8  trillion  USD  without  discounting (Mercure  et  al.  2018a).

However, a precondition for a broader analysis of transition risks and opportunities is to  go beyond the narrative of stranded assets and to consider a classification of sectors of all the economic activities that could be affected (Monasterolo 2020). This, in turn depends on their direct or indirect role in the GHG value chain, their level of substitutability with respect to fossil fuel and their role  in the  policy  landscape.  Moreover,  such  a  classification  needs  to  be  replicable  and  comparable across portfolios and jurisdictions.

The  CPRS  classification  builds  on  the international classification of economic activities (ISIC) to map the most granular level (4  digits)  into a  small  set of  categories  characterised by  differing types  of  risk:  fossil-fuel  (i.e.  all activities whose </span></div><div style="top: 54530px;" id="id13238"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13239">revenues  depends mostly and directly on fossil-fuel, including concession of  reserves and operating industrial plants for extraction and refinement); electricity (affected in terms of input but that  can  in principle  diversify  they  energy  sources);  energy  intensive  (e.g.  steel  or  cement  production  plants, automotive manufacturing plants), which are affected in terms of energy cost but not in terms of the main input);  transport  and  buildings  (affected in  terms  of  both  energy sources  and  specific  policies).

The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reported aggregate exposures to CPRS of EU insurance companies at about 13% of their total securities holdings (EIOPA 2018). Further analyses on the EU securities  holdings  indicate  that  among  financial  investments  in  bonds  issued  by  non-financial corporations, EU institutions hold exposures to CPRS ranging between 36.8%for investment funds to 47.7% for insurance corporations; analogous figures for equity holdings range from  36.4%  for  banks to  43.1% for  pension  funds (Alessi et al. 2019).

But  the  realisation  of  the transition pathway depends itself on how, collectively,  society,  including  financial  investors  and  supervisors, perceive  the  risk  of  taking  / not taking the transition scenario. The circularity between perception of risk and realisation of the scenario simplifies first of all those multiple scenarios are possible, and that which scenario is ultimately realised can depend on policy action. The coordination problem associated also with low-carbon investments opportunities increases the uncertainty. Further, not all low-carbon activities are directly functional to the transition (e.g. investments in pharmaceutical, IT companies, or financial intermediaries), thus not all reallocations of capital lead to the same path. </span></div><div style="top: 55600px;" id="id13441"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13442">In  this  context,  probabilities  of  occurrence  of  scenarios  are  difficult  to assess and this is important because risk vary widely across the different scenarios. In this context a major challenge is the fat-tail nature of  physical  risk.  One  the  one  hand,  forecasts  of climate change and its impact on humans and ecosystems imply tail events (Weitzman 2014) and tipping points which cannot be overcome by model consensus  (Knutti  2010).

Thus,  more  knowledge  is  needed  on  the interaction  of  climate  physical  and transition  risk,  the  possible  reinforcing feedbacks  and  transmission  channels to the  economy and  to finance. Moreover, models need to account for compound risk, i.e. the interaction of climate physical and/ or transition risk with other sources of risk such as pandemics, as the COVID-19. </span></div><div style="top: 55764px;" id="id13456"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13457">Challenges for  climate  transition  scenarios.  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13458">The  endogeneity  of  risk  and  its  associated  deep uncertainty implies that the standard approach to financial risk consisting of computing expected values and risk based on historical values of market prices, is not adequate for climate risk (Bolton et al. 2020) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13462">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13463">. To address this challenge, a recent stream of work has developed an approach to make use of climate policy  scenarios  to  derive  risk  measures  (e.g.  expected  shortfall)  for  financial assets  and  portfolios,  conditioned  to  scenarios  of  disorderly  transition  (Battiston  et  al.  2017; Monasterolo  and  Battiston  2020;  Roncoroni  et  al.  2020). In particular, climate policy shocks on the output  of  low/high  carbon  economic  activities  are  calculated  based  on  trajectories  of  energy technologies  as  provided  by  large-  scale  Integrated  Assessment  Models  (Kriegler  et  al.  2015; McCollum  et  al.  2018)  conditioned  to  the  introduction  of  specific  climate  policies  over  time.

These scenarios have been used for instance, in an assessment of transition risk conducted at a national central bank (Allen et al. 2020).

First, a consensus among financial supervisors  and  actors  on  scenarios  of  transition  risk  that  are  too  mild  could  lead  to  a  systematic underestimation of risk.

A review  of  the  economic  mechanisms  involved  in  the  accumulation of  systemic  risk associated to declining industries, with focus on fossil fuels, is given by (Semieniuk et al. 2021). An example is the transport sector, which uses around 50% of oil extracted (IEA 2018; Thomä  2018).    A  rapid diffusion of electric vehicles (and other alternative vehicle types), poses an important risk of as it could lead to oil demand peaking before 2050 far before mid-century (Mercure et al. 2018b; Mercure  et al. 2021). New technologies and fuel switching in aviation,  heavy industry and  shipping  could  further  displace liquid fossil fuel demand (IEA 2017). A rapid diffusion of solar photovoltaic could displace electricity generation based  predominantly on coal and  gas (Sussams and Leaton 2017).  A  rapid  diffusion  of household and  commercial  indoor  heating  and cooling  based  on electricity could further reduce the demand for oil, coal and gas (Knobloch et al. 2019). Parallels can be  made  with  earlier  literature  on  great  waves  of  innovation,  eras  of  clustered  technological innovation  and  diffusion  between  which periods  of  economic,  financial  and  social  instability  have emerged (Freeman and Louca 2001; Perez 2009). </span></div><div style="top: 56725px;" id="id13647"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13648">Due  to  the  predominantly  international  nature  of  fossil  fuel  markets,  assets  may  be  at  risk  from regulatory  and technological  changes  both  domestically  and  in  foreign  countries  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13651">(medium confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13653">.  Fossil-fuel  exporting  nations  with  lower  competitiveness  could  lose  substantial amounts of industrial activity and employment in scenarios of peaking or declining demand for fossil fuels. In scenarios of peaking oil demand, production is likely to concentrate towards the Middle-East and OPEC  countries  (IEA 2017).  Since  state-owned  fossil  fuel  companies  tend  to  enjoy  lower production  cost,  privately-owned  fossil  fuel  companies  are  more  at  risk (Thomä 2018).  Losses  of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13659">employment  may be  directly linked to losses  of  fossil-related  industrial  activity or indirectly linked through losses of large institutions, notably of government income from extraction royalties and export duties.

In order to reduce the number of scenarios to consider, Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs, Chapter 3), have been elaborated to illustrate  key  features  that  characterise  the  possible  climate  (policy)  futures.  The  following considerations  can  be  useful  for  scenario  end-users  who  carry  out  risk  analyses  on  the  basis  of  the scenarios  described  in  Chapter  3.  It  is  possible  to  associate  climate  policy  scenarios  with  levels  of physical and/or transition risk, but these are not provided with the scenario data themselves.  </span></div><div style="top: 57673px;" id="id13840"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13841">On the one hand, each scenario is associated with a warming path, which in turn, on the basis of the results from WGII, implies certain levels of physical risk (see WGII Chapter 16).

On the other hand, while mitigation can come with transition risk, in the case of lack of coordination among the actors, as discussed earlier in this section, this is not modelled explicitly in the trajectories, since the financial sector is not represented in underlying models. The scientific state of the art in climate-related financial risk offers an analysis that is not yet comprehensive of both the physical and transition risk dimensions in the same quantitative framework. However, decision makers can follow a mixed approach where they can combine quantitative risk assessment for transition risk with more qualitative risk analysis related to physical risk. </span></div><div style="top: 57831px;" id="id13854"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id13855">Figure 15.6 represents sequences of events following along a scenario both in terms of physical risk (left) and transition risk (right).

The reallocation of revenues from carbon taxes can be used for low-carbon investments, supporting poorer sections of society and fostering technological change  (High-Level  Commission  on  Carbon  Prices  2017).  In  combination  with  other  policies,  such  as  subsidies, public R&amp;Ds on resource-saving technologies, properly designed carbon taxes can facilitate the shift towards low-carbon, resource-efficient investments (Bovari et al. 2018; Naqvi and Stockhammer 2018; Dunz et al. 2021). (see Chapter 9.9.3 for carbon taxes). The effectiveness of carbon pricing has been supported  by  various  evidences.  EU  ETS  has  been  cut  the  emissions  by  42.8%  in  the  main  sectors covered  (European  Commission  2021a),  and  China  had  achieved  emissions  reductions  and  energy conservations  through  its  pilot  ETS  between  2013  and  2015  (Hu  et  al.  2020;  Zhang  et  al.  2019).

The expansion of carbon prices is dependent on  country-specific  fiscal  and  social  policies  to  hedge  against  regressive  impacts  on  welfare, competitiveness, and employment (Michaelowa et al. 2018). Such impacts need to be offset using the proceeds of carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances to reduce distortive taxation  (Bovenberg and  de  Mooij  1994;  Goulder  1995;  de  Mooij  2000;  Chiroleu-Assouline  and  Fodha  2014)  and  fund compensating measures for the population sections that are most adversely impacted  (Combet et al. 2010; Jaccard 2012; Klenert et al. 2018). This is more difficult for developing countries with a large share of energy-intensive activities, fossil fuels exporting countries and  countries which have lower potential to mitigate impacts due to lower wages or existing taxes (Lefèvre et al. 2018).  </span></div><div style="top: 61996px;" id="id14764"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14765">Non-carbon  price  instruments,  such  as  market-oriented  regulation,  public  programs  involving  low carbon infrastructure, may be preferential in developing countries where market and regulatory failure and  political economy constraints  are more  prevalent  (Finon  2019).  .  While  the  carbon  pricing  was suggested by many economists and researchers (Nordhaus 2015; Pahle et al. 2018), overcoming the political  and  regulatory  barriers  would  be  necessary  for  the  further  implementation  of  an  effective carbon pricing nationally and internationally.

It is important to efficiently allocate the public financing, and  SIBs can take up key roles (i) to provide capital to assist with overcoming financial barriers, (ii) to signal and direct investments towards green projects, and (iii) to attract the private investors by taking up a de-risking role.

Besides other weaknesses, the LCOE concept usually does not consider societal costs resulting from de-risking instruments and/or other public interventions/support and therefore caution has to be applied when using the LCOE as the indicator sole of the success of enabling environments. The yearly IRENA  mapping  on  renewable  energy  auction  results  demonstrates  the  extremely  broad  ranges  of LCOEs (equal to the agreed tariffs) for renewable energy which can be observed (IRENA 2019a). For example, in 2018, solar PV LCOEs for utility-scale projects came in between 0.04 USD/kWh and 0.35 USD/kWh with a global weighted average of 0.085 USD/kWh.

With long-term economic impacts of climate change being in the focus of the modelling community, the volatility of GDP in the short term driven by shocks is more difficult to analyse and requires country-specific deep-dives.

The latter might result in a continued overestimation of future GDP as happened in the past increasing the vulnerability of highly indebted countries  (Guzman 2016; Mallucci 2020). While  climate  change  considerations  have  already  impacted  country  ratings  and  debt  sustainability assessments (and financing costs), it is unclear whether current GDP forecasts are realistic. The review of the IMF debt sustainability framework leads to a stronger focus on vulnerability rather than only income thresholds when deciding upon eligibility for debt relief and/or concessional resources (Mitchell 2015), which could become a mitigation factor for the challenge described before.  </span></div><div style="top: 67652px;" id="id15955"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15956">Debt levels globally but particularly in developing and vulnerable countries have significantly increased </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15958">over  the  past  years  with  current  and  expected  climate  change  impacts  further  burdening  debt sustainability </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15960">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15961">.

With many vulnerable countries already being burdened with higher financing costs, this limited fiscal space further shrinks their  ability  to  actively  steer  the  required  transformation  (Buhr  et  al.  2018).

Additionally, if the required threshold is not met, there may be no pay-out, though a country may have experienced substantial damages from a climatic event. (This occurred for the Solomon Islands in 2014 which  discontinued  its  insurance  with the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Pilot  when  neither its Santa Cruz earthquake nor the 2014 flash floods were eligible to receive a pay-out under the terms of the insurance (Lucas 2015). </span></div><div style="top: 70778px;" id="id16703"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16704">Increasingly, climate risk insurance scheme is being blended into disaster risk management as part of a comprehensive risk management approach </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16706">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16707">.

There are very obvious and significant challenges.  According  to  (Kreft  and  Schäfer  2017),  limitations  of  insurance  schemes,  include coordination  challenges,  limited  scope,  de-stabilization  due  to  exit  of  one  or  more  members  as premiums risk and inadequate attention to permanent (Schaeffer et al. 2014).

Since 2016, ARC has increased its scope to cover drought and in 2019 launched ARC Replica which not only covers drought but offers premiums and coverage to NGOs and the World Food Programme through the START Network and a pastoral drought product for protecting small farmers and ensuring food security. In some regions and countries, there may also be limited access to reinsurance (Schaeffer et al. 2014; Lucas 2015). An important down-side of climate risk pooling is that it does not cover the actual cost of damage and losses. Though on the positive side, pay-out may exceed costs, but it may also be less than cost. Hence, the parametric approach is not a panacea and does not preclude having recourse to conventional indemnity insurance, which  will  cover  full  damage  costs  after  a  climate  change  event  as  it  involves  full  on  the  ground assessment of factors such as the necessity and costs of repair versus say replacement value of damaged infrastructure. This may be important for governmental and publicly provided services such as schools, hospitals, roads, airports, communications equipment and water supply facilities. Given the growing popularity    of  parametric  insurance  and  climate  risk  pooling,  there  are  very  ambitious  attempts  to expand  this  approach  on  several  fronts  (Scherer  2017).  (Schoenmaker  and  Zachmann  2015)  have proposed a global climate risk pool to help the most vulnerable countries. The pathway to this includes capacity  building  in  underdeveloped  financing  sectors  of  developing  countries.  They  argue  that  as climate extreme become more normalised, they will wipe out significant part of the infrastructure and productive capacity of developing countries.

The FCDO study examines the uptake of ARC and its impact on reducing vulnerability to disasters. It notes that there is scarce literature on disaster risk insurance mechanism in terms of impacts. In its current sample of 20 countries as of November 2017, 4 are projected to experience food security crisis (IPC Level 3) but are not signatories to the ARC which may signal that ARC is not attractive to all food insecure countries and that there is no overwhelming appetite for ARC among poorer countries. Additionally, (Panda and Surminski 2020), research on the importance of indicators and frameworks for monitoring the performance and impact of CDRI make no final assessment of any of the regional climate risk pool. However, they propose mechanisms to improve the transparency and accountability of the system.

Of course, this does not mean that risk pools are without challenges or are not failing on specific sets of metrics. (Forest 2018) flags three failings areas: policy holder and hazard coverage, the cost of premium and risk transfer parameters and the use of pay-out, which in most cases are up to the government. Here, ARC is flagged among the three regional Risk pools, as the only one with contingency plan requirement that can support effective use of pay-outs. Other research exploring climate risk pool and its impacts, flag lack of transparency around pay-out, premium or risk transfer parameters. Ultimately, climate risk pools are not full insurance; they offer only limited coverage. Entities such as the UK Anti-Corruption Help desk is exploring how to mitigate potential corruption with regard to climate risk insurance. </span></div><div style="top: 72726px;" id="id17113"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id17114">15.6.5</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id17116">Widen the focus of relevant actors: Role of communities, cities and sub-national </span></div><div style="top: 72741px;" id="id17118"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id17119">levels  </span></div><div style="top: 72764px;" id="id17121"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17122">There is an urgency and demand to meet the financial needs of the climate change actions not only at the national level but also at the subnational level, to achieve low-carbon and climate-resilient cities and communities (Barnard 2015; Moro et al. 2018) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17125">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17126">.

In poorer cities, these differing features continue to be inhibited by contextual characteristics of subnational finance, including gaps in domestic and foreign capital (Meltzer 2016), the mismatch between investment needs and  available  finance  (Gorelick  2018),  weak  financial  autonomy,  insufficient  financial  maturity, investment-grade credit ratings in local debt markets (Bahl and Linn 2014), scarce diversified funding sources and stakeholders (Gorelick 2018; Zhan et al. 2018; Zhan and de Jong 2018) and weak enabling environments (Granoff et al. 2016).</span></div><div style="top: 74324px;" id="id17495"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17496">The depth and character of the local capital market also affect cities differently in generating bonds </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17498">(high  confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17499">.

A report on post-issuance green bond impact reporting notes that despite concerns (Shishlov et al. 2018), greenwashing incidence is rare, with 77% of green bond issuers reporting on allocation and 59% reporting on impact, but with significant variance in quality and consistency of impact reporting  (CBI 2021b).  </span></div><div style="top: 76274px;" id="id17906"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17907">Financial disclosure regulatory developments can help further align and specify definitions of green in the financial sector but are not a substitute for climate policy </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17909">(high confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17910">.

Several  studies  also  show  a  recent  emergence  of  a  premium  and oversubscription for some green labelled bonds denominated in EUR (CBI 2019b), in some cases for both USD or EUR (Ehlers and Packer 2017) green bonds, with a wide variation in the range of the observed  difference  in  basis  points  focusing  on  the  secondary  market  (Gianfrate  and  Peri  2019; Nanayakkara and Colombage 2019; Zerbib 2019), with financial institution and corporate green bonds exhibiting a marginal premium compared with their non-green comparisons (Hachenberg and Schiereck 2018; Kempa et al. 2021). </span></div><div style="top: 77235px;" id="id18100"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18101">Spill over effects of green bonds may also impact equity markets and other financing conditions.

There is also a lack of impact reporting requirements and consistency in the green bond market. Impact reporting is not typically required for green bond listings on specific exchanges, nor are there any requirements for independent  reviews  of  impact  reporting,  however  this  could  change  in  future  if  investors  apply pressure. </span></div><div style="top: 77852px;" id="id18266"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18267">Green-labelled  products  may  not  necessarily  result  in  increased  financial  flows  to  climate  projects, although there can be benefits from capacity building with issuing institutions. Green bonds can be used to finance new climate projects or refinance existing climate projects, and thus do not necessarily result in finance for new climate projects constituting additional GHG reductions (a framing used in the Clean Development Mechanism). The labelling process itself may not necessarily lead to additional financing (Dupre et al. 2018;  Nicol et  al.  2018b).  However, the  labelling  process  has  merit  in contributing to building  capacity  within  issuing  institutions  on  climate  change  (Schneeweiss  2019),  which  could support identification of new green projects in the pipeline. </span></div><div style="top: 77969px;" id="id18277"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18278">Climate risk disclosure initiatives, some of which are voluntary in nature, may have a limited direct climate  impact.

Nevertheless,  since  the  post  SDG adoption period, there has been a notable uptake on research linking sustainable business practices and financial performance (Muhmad and Muhamad 2020a). This research shows that there is a growing business  case  for  ESG  investing,  with  evidence  increasingly  indicating  a  non-negative  co-relation between ESG, SDG adoption and corporate financial performance  (Friede et al. 2015; Muhmad and Muhamad 2020b), and ESG performance having a positive relation with stock returns (Consolandi et al. 2020). Research, focused on developed economies, also indicates towards a positive relation between ESG criteria and disclosure, and economic sustainability of a firm (Giese et al. 2019; Alsayegh et al. 2020)  and  allays  investor  fears  by  showing  that  sustainable  finance  initiatives,  such  as  divestment, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18479">doesn’t adversely impact investment portfolio performance </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18480">(Henriques and Sadorsky 2018; Trinks et al. 2018). It should be reiterated, that this research assesses the co-relation between ESG criteria and corporate  financial  performance,  with  the  researchers  in  some  cases,  such  as  (Friede  et  al.  2015), including  disclaimers  of  the  results  being  inconclusive  and  highlighting  the  need  for  a  deeper assessment for linking ESG criteria with impact on financial performance.  </span></div><div style="top: 78958px;" id="id18486"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18487">On the other hand, there is growing evidence for a sustainable investment lens having a broader positive impact  on  creating  an  enabling  environment  and  strengthening  the  case  for  such  investments.  For instance, CSR activities and investments on the environment dimension, specifically in the areas of emission and resource reduction, were found to be profitable and a predictor of future abnormal returns in the longer term, from additional cash flow and additional demand (Dorfleitner et al. 2018). These factors could be contributing to the increasing trend of sustainable and green investments, and can said to be further reiterated by the spate of investor led collaborative initiatives and recent announcements by leading finance institutes in the developed economies, which is well recorded in a range of recent grey  literature,  including  new  climate-aligned  investment  strategies  and  ambition  towards  net  zero targets.  </span></div><div style="top: 79104px;" id="id18498"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18499">Yet there is also a risk of companies announcing projected sustainability or net zero targets and claiming </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18501">the associated positive reputational impact, while having no clear action plan in place to achieve these.

Money market instruments (such as, green commercial paper) anchor the short end of the yield curve with bonds of varying  maturity treasuries,  SOEs, municipalities) to mobilise investors (Goodfriend 2011; LSEG 2018; Tolliver et al. 2019). A  variety of bonds are being used for developing countries including green (Ketterer et al. 2019), blue-water(Roth et al. 2019), transition, SDG/social, biodiversity bonds (Aglionby 2019), green/resilience bonds (AAC 2021);  gender  bonds  (Andrade  and  Prado  2020)(;  diaspora  (LSEG  2017)  and  infrastructure  project bonds (CBK 2021). Local policy-makers would gain from technical and financial assistance in building green yield curves, for example with support from multilaterals  (EIB 2012; IATFD 2016; Shi 2017; EIB 2018). Green bonds are one of the most readily accessible to help fund Paris goals (Tolliver et al. 2019; Tuhkanen and Vulturius 2020). Section 15.3.2 refers to the growth in labelled bond markets (CBI 2021b),  low  borrowing  costs  and  yield  curve  building  in  Europe  (Bahceli  2020;  Serenelli  2021; Stubbington 2021; HM Treasury and UK DMO 2021).

We use the term REDD+ broadly, not limited to REDD+ implemented under the UNFCCC decisions, including Warsaw Framework  for  REDD+  (see  Chapter  14),  but  include  voluntary  REDD+  projects,  such  as  projects which  utilise  voluntary  carbon  markets.  Finance  is  a  core  element  that  incentivise  and  implement REDD+ activities. Various financial sources are financing REDD+ activities, including bilateral and multilateral,  public  and  private,  and  international  and  domestic  sources,  with  linking  with  several finance approaches/mechanisms including results-based finance and voluntary carbon markets (FAO 2018). However, there is lack of sufficient finance for REDD+ (Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018; Maguire et al. 2021). REDD+ under the UNFCCC are implemented in three phases, readiness, implementation, and results-based payment phases. The Ecosystem Marketplace identified that at least USD 5.4 billion in REDD+ in three phases funding committed through multiple development finance institutions so far (Maguire et al. 2021), and public funds are main sources that are supporting three phases, and most of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20532">the REDD+ finance were spent to the readiness phase (Atmadja et al. 2018; Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018; Watson and Schalatek 2021). There is significant gap between the existing finance and finance needs  of  REDD+  in  each  phase  (Lujan  and  Silva-Chávez  2018).  Furthermore,  private  sector contribution to REDD+ is currently limited mostly to the project-scale payments for carbon offsets/units through voluntary carbon market (McFarland 2015; Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018).  </span></div><div style="top: 88131px;" id="id20538"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20539">Current  main  challenges  of  REDD+  finance  include  the  uncertainty  of  compliance  carbon  markets (which  allow  regulated  entities  to  obtain  and  surrender  emissions  allowances  or  offsets  to  meet regulatory emissions reduction targets) (Maguire et al. 2021), as well as limited engagement of private </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20543">sector  in  REDD+  finance  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20544">(high  confidence)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20545">.  With  regard  to  the  compliance  carbon  markets,  at  the international level, integrating climate cooperation through carbon markets into Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and including REDD+  has  potential to  enable  emission  reduction  in  more  cost-effective way, while the links between carbon markets and REDD+ under the Article 6 is under discussion at the </span></div><div style="top: 88423px;" id="id20667"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20668">UNFCCC (Environmental Defense Fund 2019; Maguire et al. 2021) (see Chapter 14). At the national and subnational levels, although compliance carbon markets such as in New Zealand, Australia and Colombia  allow  forest  carbon  units,  how  REDD+  will  be  dealt  in  the  national  and  subnational government- led compliance carbon markets are uncertain (Streck 2020; Maguire et al. 2021). As for limited engagement of private sector in REDD+ finance, there are various reasons why mobilising more private finance in REDD+ is difficult (Dixon and Challies 2015; Laing et al. 2016; Golub et al. 2018; Ehara et al. 2019; Streck 2020). The challenges include the needs of a clear understanding of carbon rights  and  transparent  regulation  on  who  can  benefit  from  national  REDD+  (Streck  2020);  a  clear regulatory framework and market certainty (Dixon and Challies 2015; Laing et al. 2016; Golub et al. 2018;  Ehara  et  al.  2019);  strong  forest  governance  (Streck  2020),  and  implementation  of  REDD+ activities in different levels, national and subnational levels. Other challenges are associated with the nature  of  forest-based  mitigation  activities,  the  costs  and  complexity  for  monitoring,  reporting  and verification  of  REDD+  activities,  because  of  the  need  to  consider  the  risks  of  permanence,  carbon leakage, and precisely determine and monitor the forest carbon sinks (van der Gaast et al. 2018; Yanai et al. 2020). Although REDD+ has many challenges to mobilise more private finance, there is discussion on exploring other finance opportunities for forest sector, such as building new blended finance models combining different funding sources like public and private finance (Streck 2016; Rode et al. 2019), and developing enhanced bonds for forest-based mitigation activities (World Bank 2017). </span></div><div style="top: 88677px;" id="id20687"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20688">Private finance opportunities for nature-based solutions.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20689"> The development of nature-based solutions face  barriers  that  relate  to  the  value  proposition,  value  delivery  and  value  capture  of  nature-based solutions business models and sustainable sources of public/private finance to tap into (Toxopeus and Polzin 2017; Mok et al. 2021) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20693">(high confidence). </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20694">However, the demand of establishing new finance and business models to attract both public and private finance to nature-based solutions is increasing in a wide  range  of  topics  such  as  urban  areas,  forestry  and  agriculture  sectors,  and  blue  natural  capital including mangroves and coral reefs (Toxopeus and Polzin 2017; EIB 2019; Cziesielski et al. 2021; Mok et al. 2021; Thiele et al. 2021; UNEP et al. 2021) Furthermore, the recognition of the needs of financial institutions to identify the physical, transition and reputational risks resulting from not only the climate change but also loss of biodiversity is gradually increasing (De Nederlandsche Bank and PBL  Netherlands  Environmental  Assessment  Agency  2020;  Dasgupta  2021;  TNFD  2021). Development  of  finance  and  business  models  for  nature-based  solutions  need  to  be  explored,  for example  through  utilizing  a  wide  range  of  financial  instruments  (e.g.  equity,  loans,  bonds,  and insurance),  and  creating  standard  metrics,  baselines  and  common  characteristics  for  nature-based solutions to promote the creation of a new asset class (Thiele et al. 2021; UNEP et al. 2021).</span></div><div style="top: 88890px;" id="id20708"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20709">15.6.8.3 Exploring gender-responsive climate finance </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20711">Global and national recognition of the lack of finance for women has led to increasing emphasis on financial inclusion for women (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20713">high confidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20714">).
