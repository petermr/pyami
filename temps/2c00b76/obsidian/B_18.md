Robust incentives for investment in innovation, especially incentives reinforced by national policy and international agreements, are central to accelerating low-carbon technological change(robust evidence, medium agreement). Policies have driven innovation, including instruments for technology push (e.g., scientific training, R&D) and demand pull (e.g., carbon pricing, adoption subsidies), as well as those promoting knowledge flows and especially technology transfer. The magnitude of the scale-up challenge elevates the importance of rapid technology development and adoption. This includes ensuring participation of developing countries in an enhanced global flow of knowledge, skills, experience, equipment, and technology itself requires strong financial, institutional, and capacity building support (robust evidence, high agreement). {2.5.4, 2.5, 2.8}
