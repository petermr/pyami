1. Introduction 

Section 1: Introduction 

This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge 
of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on 
the peer-reviewed scientific, technical and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCC’s Fifth 
Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. 

The  assessment  is  undertaken  within  the  context  of  the  evolving  international  landscape,  in  particular, 
developments  in  the  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  process,  including  the 
outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the Paris Agreement. It reflects the increasing diversity of 
those involved in climate action.  

This  report  integrates  the  main  findings  of  the  AR6  Working  Group  reports1  and  the  three  AR6  Special 
Reports2. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the 
value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, 
ecosystem  health,  human  well-being  and  sustainable  development.  Building  on  multiple  analytical 
frameworks,  including  those  from  the  physical  and  social  sciences,  this  report  identifies  opportunities  for 
transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and 
resilient development pathways3. Different regional classification schemes4 are used for physical, social and 
economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature. 

After this introduction, Section 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens with the assessment of observational 
evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its 
impacts.  It  assesses  the  current  implementation  of  adaptation  and  mitigation  response  options.  Section  3, 
‘Long-Term Climate and Development Futures’, provides a long-term assessment of climate change to 2100 
and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic futures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks 
and costs in adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable development. Section 4, ‘Near- 
Term Responses in a Changing Climate’, assesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period 
up to 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the pursuit of sustainable development. 

Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an 
assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language5. The scientific findings are drawn from the 
underlying  reports  and  arise  from  their  Summary  for  Policymakers  (hereafter  SPM),  Technical  Summary 
(hereafter TS), and underlying chapters and are indicated by {} brackets. Figure 1.1 shows the Synthesis Report 
Figures Key, a guide to visual icons that are used across multiple figures within this report. 

1  The  three  Working  Group  contributions  to  AR6  are:  Climate  Change  2021:  The  Physical  Science  Basis;  Climate  Change  2022: 
Impacts,  Adaptation  and  Vulnerability;  and  Climate  Change  2022:  Mitigation of  Climate  Change, respectively.  Their  assessments 
cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021. 
2 The three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response 
to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): 
an  IPCC  Special  Report  on  climate  change,  desertification,  land  degradation,  sustainable  land  management,  food  security,  and 
greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). 
The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019. 
3 The Glossary (Annex I) includes definitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint 
Working Group Glossary. 
4 Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and 
oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities. A new set of standard AR6 
WGI reference land and ocean regions have been defined {1.4.5, 10.1, 11.9, 12.1–12.4, Atlas.1.3.3–1.3.4}. WGIII allocates countries 
to geographical regions, based on the UN Statistics Division Classification {Annex II, WG III}. 
5  Each  finding  is  grounded  in  an evaluation  of underlying  evidence  and  agreement.  A  level of  confidence  is  expressed  using five 
qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms 
have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result: virtually certain 99–100% probability; very likely 90–100%; 
likely  66–100%;  more  likely  than  not  >50-100%;  about  as  likely  as  not  33–66%;  unlikely  0–33%;  very  unlikely  0–10%;  and 
exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; more likely than not >50–100%; and extremely unlikely 
0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood also is typeset in italics: for example, very likely. This is consistent with 
AR5. In this Report, unless stated otherwise, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.

2.1  Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution 

Section 2: Current Status and Trends 

Human  activities,  principally  through  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  have  unequivocally  caused 
global  warming,  with  global  surface  temperature  reaching  1.1°C  above  1850-1900  in  2011-2020. 
Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010-2019, with unequal historical 
and  ongoing  contributions  arising  from  unsustainable  energy  use,  land  use  and  land-use  change, 
lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, 
and between individuals (high confidence). Human-caused climate change is already affecting many 
weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse 
impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses 
and damages6 to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high confidence). 

2.1.1  Observed Warming and its Causes  

Global  surface  temperature  was  around  1.1°C  above  1850–1900  in  2011–2020  (1.09°C  [0.95°C–
1.20°C])7, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88°C [0.68°C–
1.01°C])8.  Observed  warming  is  human-caused,  with  warming  from  greenhouse  gases  (GHG), 
dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface 
temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 
1850-1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over 
at  least  the  last  2000  years  (high  confidence).  The  likely  range  of  total  human-caused  global  surface 
temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20199 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is 
likely that well-mixed GHGs10 contributed a warming of 1.0°C–2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally 
aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C–0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface 
temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, WGI 
SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2} 

Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG 
emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally 
about  56%  per  year)  of  CO2  emissions  from  human  activities  over  the  past  six  decades,  with  regional 
differences (high confidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million (ppm), 
CH4 reached 1866 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) reached 332 ppb11. Other major contributors 
to warming are tropospheric ozone (O3) and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH4 and N2O have increased 
to levels  unprecedented  in at least  800,000  years (very  high  confidence),  and there  is  high confidence  that 
current CO2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, 
increases in CO2 (47%) and CH4 (156%) concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2O (23%) are similar 
to – the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800,000 

6 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or 
non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary) 
7 The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 
to 0.22] °C). Additionally, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes 
in  surface  temperature,  including  in  the  Arctic.  These  and  other  improvements  have  also  increased  the  estimate  of  global  surface 
temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 {WGI SPM 
A1.2 and footnote 10} 
8 For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15°C [1.00°C–1.25°C] for global surface temperature, 1.65°C [1.36°C–
1.90°C] for land temperatures and 0.93°C [0.73°C–1.04°C] for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets 
(updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.  
9 The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The 
observed warming to 2010–2019 is 1.06°C [0.88°C–1.21°C]. {WGI SPM footnote 11} 
10 Contributions from emissions to the 2010-2019 warming relative to 1850-1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 
0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. 
11 For 2021 (the most recent year for which final numbers are available) concentrations using the same observational products and 
methods as in AR6 WGI are: 415 ppm CO2; 1896 ppb CH4; and 335 ppb N2O. Note that the CO2 is reported here using the WMO-
CO2-X2007 scale to be consistent with WGI. Operational CO2 reporting has since been updated to use the WMO-CO2-X2019 scale.

Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have 
increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel 
combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); net CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-
LULUCF) (green); CH4; N2O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) (light blue). These emissions have led to 
increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed GHGs CO2, CH4 and 
N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and 
N2O  is  scaled  to  match  the  assessed  individual  direct  effect  (and,  in  the  case  of  CH4  indirect  effect  via  atmospheric 
chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. 
This  estimate  arises  from  an  assessment  of  effective  radiative  forcing  and  climate  sensitivity.  The  global  surface 
temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850–1900 
(panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-
century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial 
period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-
century temperature range [0.5°C–1.5℃] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods 
were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and attribution studies synthesise information 
from climate models and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the warming observed between 1850–
1900 and 2010–2019 is caused by humans (panel (d)). The panel shows temperature change attributed to: total human 
influence; its decomposition into changes in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone and land-use 
change (land-use reflectance)); solar and volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges.

rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-
1). Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than 
half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 
[1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 
2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990. By 2019, 
the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by 
CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 
1990.  (high  confidence)  {WGIII  SPM  B1.1,  WGIII  SPM  B.1.2, WGIII  SPM  B.1.3,  WGIII  Figure  SPM.1,

12 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different GHGs in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report 
are stated in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values 
based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, 
evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of 
metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify 
the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.8, WGI 7.6; WGIII

in  2019.  GHG  emissions  are  categorised  into:  CO2-FFI;  net  CO2-LULUCF;  and  other  GHG  emissions  (CH4,  N2O, 
fluorinated gases, expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, 
the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions for each region. 
Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF 
is below the axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions. Panel (c) shows global net anthropogenic GHG 
emissions by region (in GtCO2-eq yr–1 (GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 1990–2019. Percentage values refer to the 
contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 
1997 was due to higher CO2-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat fire event in South East Asia. Regions are as 
grouped in Annex II of WGIII. Panel (d) shows population, GDP per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for 
total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO2-
FFI  data,  which  is  assessed  in  this  report  up  to  2018.  Consumption-based  emissions  are  emissions  released  to  the 
atmosphere  in  order  to  generate  the  goods  and  services  consumed  by  a  certain  entity  (e.g.,  region).  Emissions  from 
international aviation and shipping are not included. {WGIII Figure SPM.2} 

[END FIGURE 2.2 HERE] 

Regional  contributions  to  global  human-caused  GHG  emissions  continue  to  differ  widely.  Historical 
contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms 
of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions 
(Figure  2.2).  Variations  in  regional  and  national  per  capita  emissions  partly  reflect  different  development 
stages,  but  they  also  vary  widely  at  similar  income  levels.  Average  per  capita  net  anthropogenic  GHG 
emissions  in  2019  ranged  from  2.6  tCO2-eq  to  19  tCO2-eq  across  regions  (Figure  2.2).  Least  developed 
countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-
eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding CO2-LULUCF. Around 
48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 
35% of the  global  population  live  in  countries emitting  more  than 9 tCO2-eq  per capita13  (excluding  CO2-
LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita. A substantial share of 
the  population  in  these  low-emitting  countries  lack  access  to  modern  energy  services.  (high  confidence) 
{WGIII SPM B.3, WGIII SPM B3.1, WGIII SPM B.3.2, WGIII SPM B.3.3} 

Net  GHG  emissions  have  increased  since  2010  across  all  major  sectors  (high  confidence).  In  2019, 
approximately 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO2-
eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-
eq)  from  buildings14  (high  confidence).  Average  annual  GHG  emissions  growth  between  2010  and  2019 
slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 
1.4%) but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr–1 in the transport sector (high confidence). About half of 
total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation (medium confidence). 
Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 (±4.6) GtCO2 yr–1 for the period 2010–201915 (medium confidence). 
{WGIII SPM B.2, WGIII SPM B.2.1, WGIII SPM B.2.2, WGIII TS 5.6.1}  

Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from 
energy  use,  land-use  and  land  use  change,  lifestyle  and  patterns  of  consumption,  and  production. 
Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes (CO2-FFI), due to improvements in 
energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising 
global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households 
with  the  highest  per  capita  emissions  contribute  34–45%  of  global  consumption-based  household  GHG 
emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing 
share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas (a rise from about 62% to 67–72% of the global share 
between 2015 and 2020). The drivers of urban GHG emissions16 are complex and include population size,

2.1.2  Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to Date 

It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and 
rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale 
of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate 
system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions 
were the main driver17 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain 
that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence 
is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, 
ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global 
mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15–0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 
1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 
2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human 
influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence 
is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice 
area  between  1979–1988  and  2010–2019.  Human  influence  has  also  very  likely  contributed  to  decreased 
Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain 
that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean.

Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region 
across  the  globe.  Evidence  of  observed  changes  in  extremes  such  as  heatwaves,  heavy  precipitation, 
droughts,  and  tropical  cyclones,  and,  in  particular,  their  attribution  to  human  influence,  has 
strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have 
become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold 
extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-
caused climate change is the main driver of these changes. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in 
frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them 
since at least 2006. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s 
over  most  land  areas  for  which  observational  data  are  sufficient  for  trend  analysis  (high  confidence),  and 
human-caused  climate  change  is  likely  the  main  driver  (Figure  2.3).  Human-caused  climate  change  has 
contributed  to  increases  in  agricultural  and  ecological  droughts  in  some  regions  due  to  increased  land 
evapotranspiration (medium confidence) (Figure 2.3). It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 
3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades. {WGI SPM A.3, WGI SPM A3.1,

Figure 2.3: Both vulnerability to current climate extremes and historical contribution to climate change are highly 
heterogeneous with many of those who have least contributed to climate change to date being most vulnerable to 
its  impacts.  Panel  (a)  The  IPCC  AR6  WGI  inhabited  regions  are  displayed  as  hexagons  with  identical  size  in  their 
approximate geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a 
whole and for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made on different time scales or more local spatial scales might 
differ from what is shown in the figure. The  colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on 
observed changes. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement in the type of change 
for  the  region  as  a  whole,  and  grey  hexagons  are  used  when  there  is  limited  data  and/or  literature  that  prevents  an 
assessment  of  the  region  as  a  whole.  Other  colours  indicate  at  least  medium  confidence  in  the  observed  change.  The 
confidence level for the human influence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution 
and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for  high confidence, two dots for 
medium  confidence  and  one  dot  for  low  confidence  (single,  filled  dot:  limited  agreement;  single,  empty  dot:  limited 
evidence). For hot extremes, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum temperatures; 
regional  studies  using  other  indices  (heatwave  duration,  frequency  and  intensity)  are  used  in  addition.  For  heavy 
precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts

using global and regional studies. Agricultural and ecological droughts are assessed based on observed and simulated 
changes in total column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water balance 
(precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. Panel 
(b) shows the average level of vulnerability amongst a country’s population against 2019 CO2-FFI emissions per- capita 
per country for the 180 countries for which both sets of metrics are available. Vulnerability information is based on two 
global indicator systems, namely INFORM and World Risk Index. Countries with a relatively low average vulnerability 
often  have  groups  with  high  vulnerability  within  their  population  and  vice  versa.  The  underlying  data  includes,  for 
example, information on poverty, inequality, health care infrastructure or insurance coverage. Panel (c) Observed impacts 
on ecosystems and human systems attributed to climate change at global and regional scales. Global assessments focus 
on  large  studies, multi-species,  meta-analyses  and  large  reviews.  Regional  assessments  consider  evidence  on  impacts 
across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is 
assessed and both adverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may 
occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and methodology see WGII SMTS.1).  Physical 
water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and 
demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels 
reflect  the  assessment  of  attribution  of  the  observed  impact  to  climate  change.  {WGI  Figure  SPM.3,  Table  TS.5,

Climate  change  has  caused  substantial  damages, and  increasingly  irreversible19  losses,  in  terrestrial, 
freshwater,  cryospheric  and  coastal  and  open  ocean  ecosystems  (high  confidence).  The  extent  and 
magnitude  of  climate  change  impacts  are  larger  than  estimated  in  previous  assessments  (high 
confidence). Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to 
higher elevations (very high confidence). Biological responses including changes in geographic placement and 
shifting seasonal timing are often not sufficient to cope with recent climate change (very high confidence). 
Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes (high 
confidence)  and  mass  mortality  events  on  land  and  in  the  ocean  (very  high  confidence).  Impacts  on  some 
ecosystems  are  approaching  irreversibility  such  as  the  impacts  of  hydrological  changes  resulting  from  the 
retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain (medium confidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by 
permafrost  thaw  (high  confidence).  Impacts  in  ecosystems  from  slow-onset  processes  such  as  ocean 
acidification, sea level rise or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to human-caused 
climate  change  (high  confidence).  Climate  change  has  contributed  to  desertification  and  exacerbated  land 
degradation,  particularly  in  low  lying  coastal  areas,  river  deltas,  drylands  and  in  permafrost  areas  (high 
confidence). Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined 
effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events (high confidence).

Climate  change  has  reduced  food  security  and  affected  water  security  due  to  warming,  changing 
precipitation patterns, reduction and loss of cryospheric elements, and greater frequency and intensity 
of  climatic  extremes,  thereby  hindering  efforts  to  meet  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (high

in agricultural productivity over the past 50 years globally (medium confidence), with related negative crop 
yield  impacts  mainly  recorded  in  mid-  and  low  latitude  regions,  and  some  positive  impacts  in  some  high 
latitude regions (high confidence). Ocean warming in the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall 
decrease in maximum catch potential (medium confidence), compounding the impacts from overfishing for 
some  fish  stocks  (high  confidence).  Ocean  warming  and  ocean  acidification  have  adversely  affected  food 
production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in some oceanic regions (high confidence). Current levels 
of global warming are associated with moderate risks from increased dryland water scarcity (high confidence). 
Roughly half of the world’s population currently experiences severe water scarcity for at least some part of the

Climate change has adversely affected human physical health globally and mental health in assessed 
regions (very high confidence), and is contributing to humanitarian crises where climate hazards interact 
with high vulnerability (high confidence). In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in 
human  mortality  and  morbidity  (very  high  confidence).  The  occurrence  of  climate-related  food-borne  and 
water-borne  diseases  has  increased  (very  high  confidence).  The  incidence  of  vector-borne  diseases  has 
increased from range expansion and/or increased reproduction of disease vectors (high confidence). Animal 
and human diseases, including zoonoses, are emerging in new areas (high confidence). In assessed regions, 
some mental health challenges are associated with increasing temperatures (high confidence), trauma from 
extreme  events  (very  high  confidence),  and  loss  of  livelihoods  and  culture  (high  confidence)  (Figure  2.3). 
Climate change impacts on health are mediated through natural and human systems, including economic and 
social conditions and disruptions (high confidence). Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving 
displacement  in  Africa,  Asia,  North  America  (high  confidence),  and  Central  and  South  America  (medium 
confidence) (Figure 2.3) , with small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific being disproportionately 
affected  relative  to  their  small  population  size  (high  confidence).  Through  displacement  and  involuntary 
migration  from  extreme  weather  and  climate  events,  climate  change  has  generated  and  perpetuated 
vulnerability (medium confidence). {WGII SPM B.1.4, WGII SPM B.1.7} 

Human  influence  has  likely  increased  the  chance  of  compound  extreme  events23  since  the  1950s. 
Concurrent and repeated climate hazards have occurred in all regions, increasing impacts and risks to 
health,  ecosystems,  infrastructure,  livelihoods  and  food  (high  confidence).  Compound  extreme  events 
include increases in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts (high confidence); fire weather in 
some regions (medium confidence); and compound flooding in some locations (medium confidence). Multiple 
risks interact, generating new sources of vulnerability to climate hazards, and compounding overall risk (high 
confidence). Compound climate hazards can overwhelm adaptive capacity and substantially increase damage 
(high confidence). {WGI SPM A.3.5; WGII SPM. B.5.1, WGII TS.C.11.3} 

Economic impacts attributable to climate change are increasingly affecting peoples' livelihoods and are 
causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries (high confidence). Economic damages 
from  climate  change  have  been  detected  in  climate-exposed  sectors,  with  regional  effects  to  agriculture, 
forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism, and through outdoor labour productivity (high confidence) with some 
exceptions of positive impacts in regions with low energy demand and comparative advantages in agricultural

agricultural productivity, impacts on human health and food security, destruction of homes and infrastructure, 
and loss of property and income, with adverse effects on gender and social equity (high confidence). Tropical 
cyclones  have reduced  economic growth in  the  short-term  (high  confidence).  Event  attribution studies  and 
physical understanding indicate that human-caused climate change increases heavy precipitation associated 
with  tropical  cyclones  (high  confidence).  Wildfires  in  many  regions  have  affected  built  assets,  economic

are leading to losses and damages across water and food systems, and affect economic activity, with impacts 
extending beyond the area directly impacted by the climate hazard (high confidence). {WGI SPM A.3.4, WGII

Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and

may result in irrevocable losses of sense of belonging, valued cultural practices, identity and home, particularly 
for  Indigenous  Peoples  and  those  more  directly  reliant  on  the  environment  for  subsistence  (medium

are harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (high

Across  sectors  and  regions,  the  most  vulnerable  people  and  systems  have  been  disproportionately 
affected by the impacts of climate change (high confidence). LDCs and SIDS who have much lower per 
capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq, 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq) excluding CO2-
LULUCF, also have high vulnerability to climatic hazards, with global hotspots of high human vulnerability 
observed in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, SIDS and the Arctic 
(high confidence). Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to 
climatic hazards (high confidence). Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges 
and  limited  access  to  basic  services  and  resources,  violent  conflict  and  high  levels  of  climate-sensitive 
livelihoods (e.g., smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fishing communities) (high confidence). Vulnerability at 
different spatial levels is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income 
or combinations thereof (high confidence), especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities 
(high confidence). Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate 
change (high confidence). Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was 15 
times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability (high confidence). 
In the Arctic and in some high mountain regions, negative impacts of cryosphere change have been especially

2.2  Responses Undertaken to Date 

International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public 
awareness  are  accelerating  efforts  to  address  climate  change  at  multiple  levels  of  governance. 
Mitigation policies have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several 
countries  achieving  GHG  emission  reductions  for  over  a  decade.  Low-emission  technologies  are 
becoming  more  affordable,  with  many  low  or  zero  emissions  options  now  available  for  energy, 
buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and implementation progress has generated 
multiple benefits, with effective adaptation options having the potential to reduce climate risks and 
contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked finance for mitigation and adaptation has seen 
an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs. (high confidence) 

2.2.1  Global Policy Setting  

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol, and Paris 
Agreement  are  supporting  rising  levels  of  national  ambition  and  encouraging  the  development  and 
implementation of climate policies at multiple levels of governance (high confidence). The Kyoto Protocol 
led to reduced emissions in some countries and was instrumental in building national and international capacity 
for GHG reporting, accounting and emissions markets (high confidence). The Paris Agreement, adopted under 
the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy development and target-setting at national 
and  sub-national  levels,  particularly  in  relation  to  mitigation  but  also  for  adaptation,  as  well  as  enhanced 
transparency  of  climate  action  and  support  (medium  confidence).  Nationally  Determined  Contributions 
(NDCs), required under the Paris Agreement, have required countries to articulate their priorities and ambition 
with respect to climate action. {WGII 17.4, WGIII SPM B.5.1, WGIII SPM E.6, WGII TS D.1.1} 

Loss  &  Damage25  was  formally  recognized  in  2013  through  establishment  of  the  Warsaw  International 
Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM), and in 2015, Article 8 of the Paris Agreement provided a legal basis 
for  the  WIM.  There  is  improved  understanding  of  both  economic  and  non-economic  losses  and  damages, 
which is informing international climate policy and which has highlighted that losses and damages are not 
comprehensively  addressed  by  current financial,  governance  and  institutional  arrangements,  particularly in 
vulnerable developing countries (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII Cross-Chapter Box LOSS} 

Other recent global agreements that influence responses to climate change include the Sendai Framework for 
Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030), the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda (2015) and the New 
Urban Agenda (2016), and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer (2016), among others. In addition, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 
2015 by UN member states, sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and seeks to align efforts 
globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, protect the planet and promote more peaceful, prosperous and 
inclusive societies. If achieved, these agreements would reduce climate change, and the impacts on health, 
wellbeing, migration, and conflict, among others (very high confidence). {WGII TS.A.1, WGII 7 ES}  

Since AR5, rising public awareness and an increasing diversity of actors, have overall helped accelerate 
political  commitment  and  global  efforts  to  address  climate  change  (medium  confidence).  Mass  social 
movements have emerged as catalysing agents in some regions, often building on prior movements including 
Indigenous Peoples-led movements, youth movements, human rights movements, gender activism, and climate 
litigation, which is raising awareness and, in some cases, has influenced the outcome and ambition of climate 
governance (medium confidence). Engaging Indigenous Peoples and local communities using just-transition 
and  rights-based  decision-making  approaches,  implemented  through  collective  and  participatory  decision-
making  processes  has  enabled  deeper  ambition  and  accelerated  action  in  different  ways,  and  at  all  scales, 
depending on national circumstances (medium confidence). The media helps shape the public discourse about 
climate change. This can usefully build public support to accelerate climate action (medium evidence, high 
agreement). In some instances, public discourses of media and organised counter movements have impeded 
climate  action,  exacerbating  helplessness  and  disinformation  and  fuelling  polarisation,  with  negative 
implications for climate action (medium confidence). {WGII SPM C.5.1, WGII SPM D.2, WGII TS.D.9, WGII

2.2.2  Mitigation Actions to Date 

There  has  been  a  consistent  expansion  of  policies  and  laws  addressing  mitigation  since  AR5  (high 
confidence). Climate governance supports mitigation by providing frameworks through which diverse actors 
interact, and a basis for policy development and implementation (medium confidence). Many regulatory and 
economic instruments have already been deployed successfully (high confidence). By 2020, laws primarily 
focussed  on  reducing  GHG  emissions  existed  in  56  countries  covering  53%  of  global  emissions  (medium 
confidence). The application of diverse policy instruments for mitigation at the national and sub-national levels 
has grown consistently across a range of sectors (high confidence). Policy coverage is uneven across sectors 
and  remains  limited  for  emissions  from  agriculture,  and  from  industrial  materials  and  feedstocks  (high 
confidence). {WGIII SPM B.5, WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.3, WGIII SPM E.4} 

Practical  experience  has  informed  economic  instrument  design  and  helped  to  improve  predictability, 
environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, alignment with distributional goals, and social acceptance 
(high  confidence).  Low-emission  technological  innovation  is  strengthened  through  the  combination  of 
technology-push  policies,  together  with  policies  that  create  incentives  for  behaviour  change  and  market 
opportunities  (high  confidence)  (Section  4.8.3).  Comprehensive  and  consistent  policy  packages  have  been 
found to be more effective than single policies (high confidence). Combining mitigation with policies to shift 
development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting 
walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy can create health co-benefits from 
cleaner  air  and  enhanced  active  mobility  (high  confidence).  Climate  governance  enables  mitigation  by 
providing an overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, 
based  on  national  circumstances  and  in  the  context  of  international  cooperation.  Effective  governance   
enhances regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the context to mobilise finance 
(medium  confidence).  These  functions  can  be  promoted  by  climate-relevant  laws,  which  are  growing  in 
number, or climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national context (medium confidence). 
Effective and equitable climate governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political actors, 
businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local communities (medium confidence). {WGIII 
SPM E.2.2, WGIII SPM E.3, WGIII SPM E.3.1, WGIII SPM E.4.2, WGIII SPM E.4.3, WGIII SPM E.4.4} 

The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have 
fallen consistently since 2010 (Figure 2.4). Design and process innovations in combination with the use 
of digital technologies have led to near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions options 
in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010 to 2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit 
costs of solar energy (by 85%), wind energy (by 55%), and lithium-ion batteries (by 85%), and large increases 
in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for electric vehicles (EVs), albeit varying widely across 
regions (Figure 2.4). Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many 
regions,  electric  vehicles  are  increasingly  competitive  with  internal  combustion  engines,  and  large-scale 
battery  storage  on  electricity  grids  is  increasingly  viable.  In  comparison  to  modular  small-unit  size 
technologies,  the  empirical  record  shows  that  multiple  large-scale  mitigation  technologies,  with  fewer 
opportunities  for  learning,  have  seen  minimal  cost  reductions  and  their  adoption  has  grown  slowly. 
Maintaining  emission-intensive  systems  may,  in  some  regions  and  sectors,  be  more  expensive  than 
transitioning to low emission systems. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.4, WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM

For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG 
intensity production processes are at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage but they 
are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design in construction and retrofit of buildings has led to 
increasing  examples  of  zero  energy  or  zero  carbon  buildings.  Technological  innovation made  possible  the 
widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, 
and artificial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; they can increase energy efficiency, 
and  promote  the  adoption  of  many  low-emission  technologies,  including  decentralised  renewable  energy, 
while  creating  economic  opportunities.  However,  some  of  these  climate  change  mitigation  gains  can  be

Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green 
infrastructure, energy efficiency, demand side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, 
and  reduced  food  waste  and  loss,  are  technically  viable,  are  becoming  increasingly  cost  effective  and  are 
generally supported by the public, and this enables expanded deployment in many regions. (high confidence)

Figure 2.4: Unit cost reductions and use in some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. The top panel (a) shows 
global  costs  per  unit  of  energy  (USD  per  MWh)  for  some  rapidly  changing  mitigation  technologies.  Solid  blue  lines 
indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles in 
each year. Yellow shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding 
to USD55–148 per MWh). In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the three renewable energy technologies 
could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for 
the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity 
produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy 
technologies to be made. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts. Further, LCOE 
does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-
monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment. The bottom panel (b) shows cumulative global adoption for 
each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. 
A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change over the past decade. The electricity production share

The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased and financing channels have broadened 
(high confidence). Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up 
to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, but average growth has slowed since 2018 (medium confidence) and 
most climate finance stays within national borders (high confidence). Markets for green bonds, environmental, 
social  and  governance  and  sustainable  finance  products  have  expanded  significantly  since  AR5  (high 
confidence). Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk 
to  support  climate  policy  development  and  implementation  (high  confidence).  Accelerated  international 
financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions (high confidence). {WGIII SPM 
B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII TS.6.3, WGIII TS.6.4} 

Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, complemented by regulatory instruments 
mainly at the national and also sub-national and regional level (high confidence). By 2020, over 20% of global 
GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices 
have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions (medium confidence). Equity and distributional impacts of 
carbon  pricing  instruments  can  be  addressed  by  using  revenue  from  carbon  taxes  or  emissions  trading  to 
support low-income households, among other approaches (high confidence). The mix of policy instruments 
which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes 
public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand pull instruments such as deployment 
subsidies to attain scale (high confidence) (Figure 2.4). {WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM 
E.4.2, WG III TS.3}  

Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon 
intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission 
reductions for more than a decade (high confidence). While global net GHG emissions have increased since 
2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr–1 between 2010 and 
2019. Global carbon intensity (CO2-FFI per unit primary energy) also decreased by 0.3% yr–1, mainly due to 
fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with 
large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, 
reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases 
reduced or removed emissions (high confidence). At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 
and  GHG  and  consumption-based  CO2  absolute  emission  reductions  for  longer  than  10  years  since  2005 
through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted 
from  both  policies  and  changes  in  economic  structure  (high  confidence).  Some  countries  have  reduced 
production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates 
of around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively (high confidence). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that 
mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence). At 
least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the 
effects of economic and regulatory instruments (medium confidence). Growing numbers of laws and executive 
orders have impacted global emissions and are estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided 
emissions in 2016 (medium confidence). These reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth

of climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their

increasingly being used (very high confidence) and pilot projects and local experiments are being implemented 
in different sectors (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.1, WGII SPM.C.1.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.10} 

Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority (~60%) of all documented26 adaptation 
(high confidence). A large number of these adaptation responses are in the agriculture sector and these include 
on-farm  water  management,  water storage,  soil  moisture  conservation,  and  irrigation.  Other adaptations in 
agriculture include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and farm and landscape 
diversification among others (high confidence). For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures 
like early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, and 
land  use  planning  such  as  no  build  zones  or  upstream  forest  management,  can  reduce  flood  risk  (medium 
confidence).  Some  land-related  adaptation  actions  such  as  sustainable  food  production,  improved  and 
sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, 
reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have 
mitigation co-benefits (high confidence). Adaptation actions that increase the resilience of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services to climate change include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, 
reducing  fragmentation,  increasing  natural  habitat  extent,  connectivity  and  heterogeneity,  and  protecting 
small-scale  refugia  where  microclimate  conditions  can  allow  species  to  persist  (high  confidence).  Most 
innovations in urban adaptation have occurred through advances in disaster risk management, social safety 
nets and  green/blue  infrastructure (medium  confidence).  Many  adaptation measures that  benefit  health  and 
wellbeing  are  found  in  other  sectors  (e.g.,  food,  livelihoods,  social  protection,  water  and  sanitation, 
infrastructure)  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.2.1,  WGII  SPM  C.2.2,  WGII  TS.D.1.2,  WGII  TS.D.1.4,

Adaptation can generate multiple additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, 
health and well-being, food security, livelihood, and biodiversity conservation as well as reduction of risks 
and damages (very high confidence). {WGII SPM C1.1}  

Globally tracked adaptation finance has shown an upward trend since AR5, but represents only a small 
portion of total climate finance, is uneven and has developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors 
(high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly from public sources, largely through grants, 
concessional and non-concessional instruments (very high confidence). Globally, private-sector financing of 
adaptation from a variety of sources such as commercial financial institutions, institutional investors, other 
private equity, non-financial corporations, as well as communities and households has been limited, especially 
in developing countries (high confidence). Public mechanisms and finance can leverage private sector finance 
for adaptation by addressing real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for example via public-
private  partnerships  (high  confidence).  Innovations  in  adaptation  and  resilience  finance,  such  as  forecast-
based/anticipatory financing systems and regional risk insurance pools, have been piloted and are growing in 
scale  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.3.2,  WGII  SPM  C.5.4;  WGII  TS.D.1.6,  WGII  Cross-Chapter  Box

There  are  adaptation  options  which  are  effective27  in  reducing  climate  risks28  for  specific  contexts,

agriculture sector, cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, 
irrigation29,  agroforestry,  community-based  adaptation,  and  farm  and  landscape  level  diversification,  and 
sustainable land management approaches, provide multiple benefits and reduce climate risks. Reduction of 
food loss and waste, and adaptation measures in support of balanced diets contribute to nutrition, health, and 
biodiversity benefits. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2; SRCCL B.2,

Ecosystem-based Adaptation30 approaches such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest 
ecosystems reduce a range of climate change risks, including flood risks, urban heat and provide multiple co-
benefits.  Some  land-based  adaptation  options  provide  immediate  benefits  (e.g.,  conservation  of  peatlands, 
wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests); while afforestation and reforestation, restoration of high-carbon 
ecosystems, agroforestry, and the reclamation of degraded soils take more time to deliver measurable results. 
Significant  synergies  exist  between  adaptation  and  mitigation,  for  example  through  sustainable  land 
management approaches. Agroecological principles and practices and other approaches that work with natural 
processes support food security, nutrition, health and well-being, livelihoods and biodiversity, sustainability

Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have 
reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding (medium confidence) and early warning systems along with 
flood-proofing of buildings have proven to be cost-effective in the context of coastal flooding under current

sanitation systems to extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems, surveillance, and vaccine 
development  (very  high  confidence).  Adaptation  options  such  as  disaster  risk  management,  early  warning

2.3  Current Mitigation and Adaptation Actions and Policies are not Sufficient 

At  the  time  of  the  present  assessment31  there  are  gaps  between  global  ambitions  and  the  sum  of 
declared  national  ambitions.  These  are  further  compounded  by  gaps  between  declared  national 
ambitions and current implementation for all aspects of climate action. For mitigation, global GHG 
emissions in 2030 implied by NDCs announced by October 2021 would make it likely that warming 
will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C.32 
Despite  progress,  adaptation  gaps33  persist,  with  many  initiatives  prioritising  short-term  risk 
reduction,  hindering  transformational  adaptation.  Hard  and  soft  limits  to  adaptation  are  being 
reached in some sectors and regions, while maladaptation is also increasing and disproportionately 
affecting  vulnerable  groups.  Systemic  barriers  such  as  funding,  knowledge,  and  practice  gaps, 
including  lack  of  climate  literacy  and  data  hinders  adaptation  progress.  Insufficient  financing, 
especially  for  adaptation,  constraints  climate  action  in  particular  in  developing  countries.  (high

it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken (Figure 
2.5, Table 2.2). A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the 
implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission 
levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) 
with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C (>67%), assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid and 
sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade (high confidence) (Table 2.2, Table 3.1, 4.1).35 The 
magnitude  of  the  emissions  gap  depends  on  the  global  warming  level  considered  and  whether  only 
unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs36 are considered (high confidence) (Table 2.2). Modelled 
pathways  that  are  consistent  with  NDCs  announced prior  to  COP26  until  2030  and  assume  no  increase  in 
ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1–3.4]°C by 2100 
(medium confidence). If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with 
NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while 
limiting  warming  to  2°C  (>67%)  would  imply  an  unprecedented  acceleration  of  mitigation  efforts  during 
2030–2050 (medium confidence) (see Section 4.1, CSB2). {WGIII SPM B.6, WGIII SPM B.6.1, WGIII SPM

Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 
than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap’37 (high confidence) (Table 2.2, Figure 
2.5). Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 (52–60) GtCO2-
eq in 2030 (Table 2.2). This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4–7 GtCO2-eq in 
2030  (Table  2.2);  without a  strengthening  of  policies,  emissions  are  projected  to  rise, leading  to  a median 
global warming of 2.2°C–3.5°C (very likely range) by 2100 (medium confidence) (see Section 3.1.1). {WGIII

Projected  cumulative  future  CO2  emissions  over  the  lifetime  of  existing  fossil  fuel  infrastructure  without

pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83%39 (see Figure 3.5). Limiting warming to 2°C 
(>67%) or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot 
be  burned  and  emitted  if  warming  is  limited  to  2°C.  Significantly  more  reserves  are  expected  to  remain 
unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.7, WGIII Box. 6.13}

financing or monetary and/or technological transfers. This terminology is used in the literature and the UNFCCC’s NDC Synthesis

Cross-Section Box.1: Understanding Net Zero CO2 and Net Zero GHG Emissions  

Limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, 
reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other GHG emissions 
(see 3.3.2). Future additional warming will depend on future emissions, with total warming dominated by past 
and future cumulative CO₂ emissions {WGI SPM D.1.1, WGI Figure SPM.4; SR1.5 SPM A.2.2}.  

Reaching net zero CO2 emissions is different from reaching net zero GHG emissions. The timing of net 
zero for a basket of GHGs depends on the emissions metric, such as global warming potential over a 100-year 
period, chosen to convert non-CO2 emissions into CO2-equivalent (high confidence). However, for a given 
emissions pathway, the physical climate response is independent of the metric chosen (high confidence) {WGI 
SPM D.1.8; WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-chapter box 2}. 

Achieving global net zero GHG emissions requires all remaining CO2 and metric-weighted41 non-CO2 
GHG emissions to be counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals (high confidence). Some non-
CO2  emissions,  such  as  CH4  and  N2O  from  agriculture,  cannot  be  fully  eliminated  using  existing  and 
anticipated technical measures {WGIII SPM C.2.4, WGIII SPM C.11.4, Cross-Chapter Box 3}. 

Global net zero CO2 or GHG emissions can be achieved even if some sectors and regions are net emitters, 
provided that others reach net negative emissions (see Figure 4.1). The potential and cost of achieving net 
zero or even net negative emissions vary by sector and region. If and when net zero emissions for a given 
sector or region are reached depends on multiple factors, including the potential to reduce GHG emissions and 
undertake carbon dioxide removal, the associated costs, and the availability of policy mechanisms to balance 
emissions and removals between sectors and countries. (high confidence) {WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-
Chapter Box 3}. 

The adoption and implementation of net-zero emission targets by countries and regions also depend on 
equity and capacity considerations (high confidence). The formulation of net zero pathways by countries 
will benefit from clarity on scope, plans-of-action, and fairness. Achieving net zero emission targets relies on 
policies, institutions, and milestones against which to track progress. Least-cost global modelled pathways 
have been shown to distribute the mitigation effort unevenly, and the incorporation of equity principles could 
change  the  country-level  timing  of  net  zero  (high  confidence).  The  Paris  Agreement  also  recognizes  that 
peaking of emissions will occur later in developing countries than developed countries (Article 4.1) {WGIII 
Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3, WGIII 14.3}. 

More information on country-level net zero pledges is provided in S2.3.1, on the timing of global net zero 
emissions in S3.3.2, and on sectoral aspects of net zero in S4.1.

Many  countries  have  signalled  an  intention  to  achieve  net-zero  GHG  or  net-zero  CO2  emissions  by 
around mid-century (Cross-Section Box 1). More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are 
discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global 
GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net-zero GHG targets. Many 
companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets  in recent years. The various net 
zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date 
in place to deliver on them. {WGIII SPM C.6.4, WGIII TS.4.1, WGIII Table TS.1, WGIII 13.9, WGIII 14.3, 
WGIII 14.5}  

All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs 
(high confidence). Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to 
enable their application at scale (medium confidence). Current development pathways may create behavioural, 
spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales (high confidence). Choices made 
by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways 
(high confidence). Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities (e.g., economic and natural 
endowments, political systems and cultural factors and gender considerations) affect the breadth and depth of 
climate governance (medium confidence). The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, 
youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for 
climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM C.3.6, WGIII 
SPM E.1.1, WGIII SPM E.2.1, WGIII SPM E.3.3} 

The  adoption  of  low-emission  technologies  lags  in  most  developing  countries,  particularly  least 
developed  ones,  due  in  part  to  weaker  enabling  conditions,  including  limited  finance,  technology 
development and transfer,  and capacity (medium confidence).  In  many countries,  especially  those  with 
limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-
emission  technology,  e.g.,  low-value  employment,  and  dependency  on  foreign  knowledge  and  suppliers 
(medium  confidence).  Low-emission  innovation  along  with  strengthened  enabling  conditions  can  reinforce 
development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy (medium 
confidence).  Persistent  and  region-specific  barriers  also  continue  to  hamper  the  economic  and  political 
feasibility  of  deploying  AFOLU  mitigation  options  (medium  confidence).  Barriers  to  implementation  of 
AFOLU  mitigation  include  insufficient  institutional  and  financial  support,  uncertainty  over  long-term 
additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access 
to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal (high confidence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM

2.3.2  Adaptation Gaps and Barriers  

Despite  progress,  adaptation  gaps  exist  between  current  levels  of  adaptation  and  levels  needed  to 
respond  to  impacts  and  reduce  climate  risks  (high  confidence).  While  progress  in  adaptation 
implementation is observed across all sectors and regions (very high confidence), many adaptation initiatives 
prioritise immediate and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, which reduces 
the opportunity for transformational adaptation42 (high confidence). Most observed adaptation is fragmented, 
small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than implementation (high 
confidence). Further, observed adaptation is unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation 
gaps  exist  among  lower  population  income  groups  (high  confidence).  In  the  urban  context,  the  largest 
adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health 
nexus or the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk (high confidence). Many funding, knowledge 
and  practice  gaps  remain  for  effective  implementation,  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  current  adaptation 
efforts are not expected to meet existing goals (high confidence). At current rates of adaptation planning and 
implementation  the  adaptation  gap  will  continue to  grow  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.1,  WGII  SPM

have reached soft limits (medium confidence), resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy 
constraints  and  can  be  overcome  by  addressing  these  constraints  (high  confidence).  Transitioning  from 
incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits (high confidence). {WGII 
SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM.C.3.4, WGII 16 ES} 

Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft 
and hard limits. Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not 
comprehensively  addressed  by  current financial,  governance  and  institutional  arrangements,  particularly in 
vulnerable developing countries. (high confidence) {WGII SPM.C.3.5} 

There is increased evidence of maladaptation44 in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation 
are  observed  in  urban  areas  (e.g.,  new  urban  infrastructure  that  cannot  be  adjusted  easily  or  affordably), 
agriculture  (e.g.,  using  high-cost  irrigation  in  areas  projected  to  have  more  intense  drought  conditions), 
ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally fire-adapted ecosystems, or hard defences against flooding) and 
human settlements (e.g. stranded assets and vulnerable communities that cannot afford to shift away or adapt 
and require an increase in social safety nets). Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and vulnerable 
groups  adversely  (e.g.,  Indigenous  Peoples,  ethnic  minorities,  low-income  households,  people  living  in 
informal  settlements),  reinforcing  and  entrenching  existing  inequities.  Maladaptation  can  be  avoided  by 
flexible,  multi-sectoral,  inclusive  and  long-term  planning  and  implementation  of  adaptation  actions  with 
benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.4, WGII SPM C.4.3, WGII TS.D.3.1} 

Systemic barriers constrain the implementation of adaptation options in vulnerable sectors, regions and 
social  groups  (high  confidence).  Key  barriers  include  limited  resources,  lack  of  private-sector  and  civic 
engagement, insufficient mobilisation of finance, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow 
and  low  uptake  of  adaptation  science  and  a  low  sense  of  urgency.  Inequity  and  poverty  also  constrain 
adaptation, leading to soft limits and resulting in disproportionate exposure and impacts for most vulnerable 
groups  (high  confidence).  The  largest  adaptation  gaps  exist  among  lower  income  population  groups  (high 
confidence). As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and accelerated 
implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints 
remain  for  some  regions  (high  confidence).  Prioritisation  of  options  and  transitions  from  incremental  to 
transformational  adaptation  are  limited  due  to  vested  interests,  economic  lock-ins,  institutional  path 
dependencies and prevalent practices, cultures, norms and belief systems (high confidence). Many funding, 
knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation of adaptation 
(high  confidence),  including,  lack  of  climate  literacy  at  all  levels  and  limited  availability  of  data  and 
information (medium confidence); for example for Africa, severe climate data constraints and inequities in 
research funding and leadership reduce adaptive capacity (very high confidence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII 
SPM C.3.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.1.5, TS.D.2.4} 

2.3.3  Lack of Finance as a Barrier to Climate Action  

Insufficient financing, and a lack of political frameworks and incentives for finance, are key causes of 
the implementation gaps for both mitigation and adaptation (high confidence). Financial flows remained 
heavily  focused  on  mitigation,  are  uneven,  and  have  developed  heterogeneously  across  regions  and 
sectors  (high  confidence).  In  2018,  public  and  publicly  mobilised  private  climate  finance  flows  from 
developed to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to 

43 Adaptation limit: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive 
actions. Hard adaptation limit - No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit - Options are currently 
not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action. 
44  Maladaptation  refers  to  actions  that  may  lead  to  increased  risk  of  adverse  climate-related  outcomes,  including  via  increased 
greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now 
or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. See Annex I: Glossary.

mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency 
on implementation (medium confidence). Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than 
those for climate adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate 
finance  is  directed  towards  mitigation  (very  high  confidence).  Nevertheless,  average  annual  modelled 
investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three 
to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) 
would need to increase across all sectors and regions (medium confidence). Challenges remain for green bonds 
and similar products, in particular around integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of 
these markets to many developing countries (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII 
SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E5.1}  

Current global financial flows for adaptation including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient 
for and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries (high confidence). 
There are widening disparities between the estimated costs of adaptation and the documented finance allocated 
to adaptation (high confidence). Adaptation finance needs are estimated to be higher than those assessed in 
AR5, and the enhanced mobilisation of and access to financial resources are essential for implementation of 
adaptation  and  to  reduce  adaptation  gaps  (high  confidence).  Annual  finance  flows  targeting  adaptation  for 
Africa, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate 
change (high confidence). Adverse climate impacts can further reduce the availability of financial resources 
by causing losses and damages and impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial 
constraints for adaptation particularly for developing countries and LDCs (medium confidence). {WGII SPM 
C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII TS.D.1.6}  

Without effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will continue to disproportionately affect the 
poorest  and  most  vulnerable  populations.  Accelerated  financial  support  for  developing  countries  from 
developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler to enhance mitigation action {WGIII SPM. E.5.3}. 
Many developing countries lack comprehensive data at the scale needed and lack adequate financial resources 
needed  for  adaptation  for  reducing  associated  economic  and  non-economic  losses  and  damages.  (high

There  are  barriers  to  redirecting  capital  towards  climate  action  both  within  and  outside  the  global 
financial sector. These barriers include: the inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment 
opportunities, regional mismatch between available capital and investment needs, home bias factors, country 
indebtedness levels, economic vulnerability, and limited institutional capacities. Challenges from outside the 
financial  sector  include:  limited local  capital markets;  unattractive  risk-return  profiles, in  particular  due  to 
missing  or  weak  regulatory  environments  that  are  inconsistent  with  ambition  levels;  limited  institutional

Cross-Section Box.2: Scenarios, Global Warming Levels, and Risks 

Modelled scenarios and pathways45 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and 
risks, and possible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including 
socio-economic variables and mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions 
nor forecasts. Global modelled emission pathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain 
regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of 
these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about global equity, environmental justice or intra-
regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the scenarios in the 

45 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to 
climate goals. WGI primarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emissions and mitigation pathways. 
The SYR primarily uses scenarios when referring to WGI and modelled emissions and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.

Socio-economic Development, Scenarios, and Pathways 
The five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 to SSP5) were designed to span a range of challenges to 
climate change mitigation and adaptation. For the assessment of climate impacts, risk and adaptation, the SSPs 
are  used  for  future  exposure,  vulnerability  and  challenges  to  adaptation.  Depending  on  levels  of  GHG 
mitigation,  modelled  emissions  scenarios  based  on  the  SSPs  can  be  consistent  with  low  or  high  warming 
levels47. There are many different mitigation strategies that could be consistent with different levels of global 
warming in 2100 (see Figure 4.1). {WGI Box SPM.1; WGII Box SPM.1; WGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box 
TS.5, WGIII Annex III; SRCCL Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.2} 

WGI  assessed  the  climate  response  to  five  illustrative  scenarios  based  on  SSPs48  that  cover  the  range  of 
possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. These scenarios 
combine  socio-economic  assumptions,  levels  of  climate  mitigation,  land  use  and  air  pollution  controls  for 
aerosols  and non-CH4  ozone  precursors.  The high  and  very high  GHG  emissions  scenarios  (SSP3-7.0 and 
SSP5-8.5) have CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively49. The 
intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the 
middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have CO2 
emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative 
CO2 emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)50 were used by WGI and WGII to 
assess regional climate changes, impacts and risks. {WGI Box SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2, Figure 1) 

In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways 
were categorised based on their projected global warming over the 21st century, with categories ranging from 
pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood51 with no or limited overshoot (C1) to 
pathways that exceed 4°C (C8). Methods to project global warming associated with the modelled pathways 
were updated to ensure consistency with the AR6 WGI assessment of the climate system response52. {WGIII 
Box SPM.1, WGIII Table 3.1} (Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2, Figure 1) 

Global Warming Levels (GWLs) 
For many climate and risk variables, the geographical patterns of changes in climatic impact-drivers53 and 
climate impacts for a level of global warming54 are common to all scenarios considered and independent of 

46 Around half of all modelled global emissions pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement 
options globally. The other half look at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.  The underlying population 
assumptions range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 7.4 to 10.9 billion in 2100 (5–95th percentile) starting from 7.6 billion in 2019. 
The underlying assumptions on global GDP growth range from 2.5 to 3.5% per year in the 2019–2050 period and 1.3 to 2.1% per year 
in the 2050–2100 (5–95th percentile). {WGIII Box SPM.1}. 
47 High mitigation challenges, for example, due to assumptions of slow technological change, high levels of global population growth, 
and high fragmentation as in the Shared Socio-economic Pathway SSP3, may render modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (> 
67%) or lower infeasible (medium confidence) {SRCCL Box SPM.1; WGIII SPM C.1.4}. 
48  SSP-based  scenarios  are  referred  to  as  SSPx-y,  where  ‘SSPx’  refers  to  the  Shared  Socioeconomic  Pathway  describing  the 
socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm-2) 
resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {WGI SPM footnote 22} 
49 Very high emission scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Temperature levels > 4C may result from very high 
emission scenarios, but can also occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than 
the best estimate. 
50 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square 
metre, or Wm-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {WGII SPM footnote 21}

assessment  outcomes  are  used  to  categorise  thousands  of  scenarios  via  simple physically-based  climate  models  (emulators)  {WGI

running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change exceeds the level of global warming.

Risks 
Dynamic  interactions  between  climate-related  hazards,  exposure  and  vulnerability  of  the  affected  human

Risks  can  also  arise  from  climate  change  mitigation  or  adaptation  responses  when  the  response  does  not 
achieve its intended objective, or when it results in adverse effects for other societal objectives. {WGII SPM

Section 3: Long-Term Climate and Development Futures 

3.1  Long-Term Climate Change, Impacts and Related Risks 

Future warming will be driven by future emissions and will affect all major climate system components, 
with  every  region  experiencing  multiple  and  co-occurring  changes.  Many  climate-related  risks  are 
assessed to be higher than in previous assessments, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple 
times higher than currently observed. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in 
compounding and cascading risks across sectors and regions. Sea level rise, as well as other irreversible 
changes, will continue for thousands of years, at rates depending on future emissions. (high confidence) 

3.1.1  Long-term Climate Change  

The uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global surface temperature is narrower than in the 
AR5. For the first time in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global surface temperature, 
ocean warming and sea level are constrained using observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely 
range of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5°C–4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C) 
based  on  multiple  lines  of  evidence55,  including  improved  understanding  of  cloud  feedbacks.  For  related 
emissions  scenarios,  this  leads  to  narrower  uncertainty  ranges  for  long-term  projected  global  temperature 
change than in AR5. {WGI A.4, WGI Box SPM.1, WGI TS.3.2, WGI 4.3} 

Future  warming  depends  on  future  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  with  cumulative  net  CO2 
dominating. The assessed best estimates and very likely ranges of warming for 2081–2100 with respect to 
1850–1900 vary from 1.4°C [1.0-1.8°C] in the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C [2.1°C–
3.5°C] in the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C [3.3°C–5.7°C] in the very high GHG 
emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)56. {WGI SPM B.1.1, WGI Table SPM.1, WGI Figure SPM.4} (Cross-Section 
Box.2, Figure 1) 

Modelled pathways consistent with the continuation of policies implemented by the end of 2020 lead to 
global warming of 3.2 [2.2-3.5]°C (5–95% range) by 2100 (medium confidence) (see also Section 2.3.1). 
Pathways of >4°C (≥50%) by 2100 would imply a reversal of current technology and/or mitigation policy 
trends  (medium  confidence).  However,  such  warming  could  occur  in  emissions  pathways  consistent  with 
policies implemented by the end of 2020 if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the 
best estimate (high confidence). {WGIII SPM C.1.3} 

Global  warming  will  continue  to  increase  in  the  near  term  in  nearly  all  considered  scenarios  and 
modelled  pathways.  Deep,  rapid  and  sustained  GHG  emissions  reductions,  reaching  net  zero  CO2 
emissions and including strong emissions reductions of other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to 
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) or less than 2°C (>67%) by the end of century (high confidence). The 
best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global warming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered 
scenarios and modelled pathways57. In the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions reach 
net zero around 2050 and the best-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot (see 
Section 3.3.4) of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. Global warming of 2°C will be exceeded 
during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming decades. 

55 Understanding of climate processes, the instrumental record, paleoclimates and model-based emergent constraints (see Annex I: 
Glossary). {WGI SPM footnote 21} 
56 The best estimates [and very likely ranges] for the different scenarios are: 1.4°C [1.0°C–1.8°C] (SSP1-1.9); 1.8°C [1.3°C–2.4°C] 
(SSP1-2.6);  2.7°C  [2.1°C–3.5°C]  (SSP2-4.5); 3.6°C  [2.8°C–4.6°C]  (SSP3-7.0);  and  4.4°C  [3.3°C–5.7°C]  (SSP5-8.5).  {WGI  Table 
SPM.1} (CSB.2) 
57 In the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is  very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0), more likely 
than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low 
GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). In all scenarios considered by WGI except the very high emissions scenario, the midpoint of the 
first 20-year running average period during which the assessed global warming reaches 1.5°C lies in the first half of the 2030s. In the 
very high GHG emissions scenario, this mid-point is in the late 2020s. Median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming 
level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is 2030-2035. {WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI

Deep, rapid and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would lead to improvements in air quality within a 
few years, to reductions in trends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, and over 
longer  time  periods  for  many  other  climate  impact-drivers58  (high  confidence).  Targeted  reductions  of  air 
pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality compared to reductions in GHG emissions 
only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air 
pollutants as well as GHG emissions (high confidence)59. {WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI SPM D.1,

Section Box 2, Figure 1) 

Changes in short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) resulting from the five considered scenarios lead to an 
additional  net  global  warming  in  the  near  and  long  term  (high  confidence).  Simultaneous  stringent 
climate change mitigation and air pollution control policies limit this additional warming and lead to 
strong benefits for air quality (high confidence). In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 
and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a 
net  global  warming  by  2100  of  likely  0.4°C–0.9°C  relative  to  2019.  This  is  due  to  projected  increases  in 
atmospheric  concentration  of  CH4,  tropospheric  ozone,  hydrofluorocarbons  and,  when  strong  air  pollution 
control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-
1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net 
cooling,  whereas  reductions  in  anthropogenic  cooling  aerosols  lead  to  a  net  warming  (high  confidence). 
Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C–0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and 
strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI 
Box TS.7} (CSB.2) 

Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes 
will be irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. Many changes in the climate system become 
larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. With every additional increment of global warming, 
changes in extremes continue to become larger. Additional warming will lead to more frequent and intense 
marine heatwaves and is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing and loss of seasonal snow cover, 
glaciers,  land  ice  and  Arctic  sea  ice  (high  confidence).  Continued  global  warming  is  projected  to  further 
intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation60, and very wet and 
very dry weather and climate events and seasons (high confidence). The portion of global land experiencing 
detectable  changes in  seasonal mean  precipitation is projected  to  increase (medium  confidence)  with more 
variable precipitation and surface water flows over most land regions within seasons (high confidence) and 
from year to year (medium confidence). Many changes due to past and future GHG emissions are irreversible61 
on centennial to millennial time scales, especially in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level (see 3.1.3). 
Ocean  acidification  (virtually  certain),  ocean  deoxygenation  (high  confidence)  and  global  mean  sea  level 
(virtually certain) will continue to increase in the 21st century, at rates dependent on future emissions. {WGI

With  further  global  warming,  every  region  is  projected  to  increasingly  experience  concurrent  and 
multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers. Increases in hot and decreases in cold climatic impact-drivers, 
such as temperature extremes, are projected in all regions (high confidence). At 1.5°C global warming, heavy 
precipitation  and  flooding  events  are  projected  to  intensify  and  become  more  frequent  in  most  regions  in 
Africa, Asia (high confidence), North America (medium to high confidence) and Europe (medium confidence). 
At 2°C or above, these changes expand to more regions and/or become more significant (high confidence), 
and  more  frequent  and/or  severe  agricultural  and  ecological  droughts  are  projected  in  Europe,  Africa, 
Australasia  and  North,  Central  and  South  America  (medium  to  high  confidence).  Other  projected  regional

3.1.2 

Impacts and Related Risks 

For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5 (high 
confidence). Levels of risk63 for all Reasons for Concern64 (RFCs) are assessed to become high to very high 
at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5 (high confidence). This is based upon 
recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and 
vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global 
warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed (high 
confidence) for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, 
including cascading risks (see 3.1.3) and risks from overshoot (see 3.3.4), are projected to become increasingly 
severe with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). {WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM B.4, 
WGII SPM B.5, WGII 16.6.3; SRCCL SPM A5.3} (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3) 

Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present 
(1.1°C) but lower than at 2°C (high confidence) (see Section 2.1.2). Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, 
food  security,  water  supply,  human  security,  and  economic  growth  are  projected  to  increase  with  global 
warming of 1.5°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3–14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will  likely 
face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% 
at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around 
the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries (high confidence). Regions 
at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island development states 
and Least Developed Countries (high confidence). {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII TS.C.4.2; SR1.5 
SPM A.3, SR1.5 SPM B.4.2, SR1.5 SPM B.5, SR1.5 SPM B.5.1} (Figure 3.3) 

At  2°C  of  global  warming,  overall risk levels  associated  with  the  unequal distribution  of impacts (RFC3), 
global  aggregate  impacts  (RFC4)  and  large-scale  singular  events  (RFC5)  would  be  transitioning  to  high 
(medium confidence), those associated with extreme weather events (RFC2) would be transitioning to very 
high (medium confidence), and those associated with unique and threatened systems (RFC1) would be very 
high  (high  confidence)  (Figure  3.3,  panel  a).  With  about  2°C  warming,  climate-related  changes  in  food 
availability  and  diet  quality  are  estimated  to  increase  nutrition-related  diseases  and  the  number  of 
undernourished people, affecting tens (under low vulnerability and low warming) to hundreds of millions of 
people (under high vulnerability and high warming), particularly among low-income households in low- and 
middle-income  countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  South  Asia  and  Central  America  (high  confidence).  For 
example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river 
basins by up to 20% (medium confidence). Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure 
will rise sharply in the mid- and long-term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed 
to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities (high confidence). {WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII 
SPM B.4.2, WGII SPM B.4.5, WGII TS C.3.3, WGII TS.C.12.2} (Figure 3.3) 

63 Undetectable risk level indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk indicates 
associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other 
specific criteria for key risks; high risk indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for 
assessing key risks; and very high risk level indicates very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or 
the persistence of  climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impacts/risks. 
{WGII Figure SPM.3} 
64 The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories 
{WGII Figure SPM.3}. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges 
constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the 
Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human 
health,  livelihoods,  assets  and  ecosystems  from  extreme  weather  events  such  as  heatwaves,  heavy  rain,  drought  and  associated 
wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to 
uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-
ecological  systems  that  can  be  aggregated globally  into  a  single  metric,  such  as  monetary  damages,  lives  affected,  species  lost  or 
ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes 
in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet instability or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods include a 
structured expert elicitation based on the literature described in WGII SM16.6 and are identical to AR5 but are enhanced by a structured 
approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. For further explanations of global risk levels and 
Reasons for Concern, see WGII TS.AII. {WGII Figure SPM.3}

At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying 
widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits (see Section 3.2) (high 
confidence). For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected 
to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C (medium confidence). Projected increases in 
direct flood damages are higher by 1.4–2 times at 2°C and 2.5–3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global 
warming without adaptation (medium confidence). {WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.4.2, WGII Figure SPM.3, 
WGII TS Appendix AII, WGII Atlas Fig.AI.46} (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3) 

Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems 
(high confidence). Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of 
~50% of tropical marine species (medium confidence) and biome shifts across 35% of global land area (medium 
confidence). At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both 
increasing  high  and  decreasing  low  extreme  streamflow,  affecting,  without  additional  adaptation,  over  2.1 
billion  people  (medium  confidence)  and  about  4  billion  people  are  projected  to  experience  water  scarcity 
(medium confidence). At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50–70% and the 
fire frequency by ~30% compared to today (medium confidence). {WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.4.2, WGII 
TS.C.1.2, WGII TS.C.2.3, WGII TS.C.4.1, WGII TS.C.4.4} (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3) 

 Projected  adverse  impacts  and  related  losses  and damages  from  climate  change  escalate with  every 
increment  of  global  warming  (very  high  confidence),  but  they  will  also  strongly  depend  on  socio-
economic development trajectories and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure (high 
confidence). For example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal feed, and water, more 
resource-intensive consumption and production, and limited technological improvements result in higher risks 
from  water  scarcity  in  drylands,  land  degradation  and  food  insecurity  (high  confidence).  Changes  in,  for 
example, demography or investments in health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes 
including heat-related morbidity and mortality (Figure 3.3 Panel d). {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII 
Figure SPM.3; SRCCL SPM A.6} 

With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex 
and more difficult to manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of 
compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding 
and fire weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers such as biodiversity loss or violent 
conflict will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. 
Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., 
adverse side effects of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures (see 3.4.1). (high 
confidence) {WGI SPM C.2.7, WGI Figure SPM.6, WGI TS.4.3; WGII SPM B.1.7, WGII B.2.2, WGII SPM 
B.5, WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM B.5, WGII CCB2} 

Solar  Radiation  Modification  (SRM)  approaches,  if  they  were  to  be  implemented,  introduce  a 
widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. SRM has the 
potential to offset warming within one or two decades and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not 
restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur 
at  regional  and seasonal  scales  (high confidence).  Effects  of  SRM  would  depend  on  the  specific  approach 
used65, and a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid 
climate change (high confidence). SRM would not stop atmospheric CO2 concentrations from increasing nor 
reduce  resulting  ocean  acidification  under  continued  anthropogenic  emissions  (high  confidence).  Large 
uncertainties  and  knowledge  gaps  are  associated  with  the  potential  of  SRM  approaches  to  reduce  climate 
change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of 
states could create international tensions. {WGI 4.6; WGII SPM B.5.5; WGIII 14.4.5.1; Cross-WG box SRM;

3.1.3  The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible Change 

The  likelihood  of  abrupt  and  irreversible  changes  and  their  impacts  increase  with  higher  global 
warming  levels  (high  confidence).  As  warming  levels  increase,  so  do  the  risks  of  species  extinction  or 
irreversible  loss  of  biodiversity  in  ecosystems  such  as  forests  (medium  confidence),  coral  reefs  (very  high 
confidence)  and  in  Arctic  regions  (high  confidence).  Risks  associated  with  large-scale  singular  events  or 
tipping  points,  such  as  ice  sheet  instability  or  ecosystem  loss  from  tropical  forests,  transition  to  high  risk 
between 1.5°C–2.5°C (medium confidence) and to very high risk between 2.5°C–4°C (low confidence). The 
response  of  biogeochemical  cycles  to  anthropogenic  perturbations  can  be  abrupt  at  regional  scales  and 
irreversible on decadal to century time scales (high confidence). The probability of crossing uncertain regional 
thresholds increases with further warming (high confidence). {WGI SPM C.3.2, WGI Box TS.9, WGI TS.2.6; 
WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII SPM B.3.1, WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.5.2, WGII Table TS.1, WGII TS.C.1, 
WGII TS.C.13.3; SROCC SPM B.4} 

Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice 
sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). Global mean sea 
level rise will continue in the 21st century (virtually certain), with projected regional relative sea level rise 
within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline (medium confidence). The magnitude, 
the  rate,  the  timing  of  threshold  exceedances,  and  the  long-term  commitment  of  sea  level  rise  depend  on 
emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level 
rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least 
annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and 
infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100 (high confidence). At sustained warming levels between 
2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over 
multiple millennia (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global 
surface temperatures (high confidence). Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–
3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to 2°C (low confidence). Projections of multi-millennial

global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: global 
mean sea level was very likely 5–25 m higher than today roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures 
were 2.5°C–4°C higher than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). Further examples of unavoidable changes in 
the climate system due to multi-decadal or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt (very 
high confidence) and permafrost carbon loss (high confidence). {WGI SPM B.5.2, WGI SPM B.5.3, WGI 
SPM B.5.4, WGI SPM C.2.5, WGI Box TS.4, WGI Box TS.9, WGI 9.5.1; WGII TS C.5; SROCC SPM B.3, 
SROCC SPM B.6, SROCC SPM B.9} (Figure 3.4) 

The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with 
higher global warming levels (high confidence). Warming substantially above the assessed very likely range 
for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is  high confidence this would lead to regional changes 
greater  than assessed in many  aspects  of  the  climate system.  Low-likelihood,  high-impact  outcomes  could 
occur  at  regional  scales  even  for  global  warming  within  the  very  likely  assessed  range  for  a  given  GHG 
emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess 
of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be ruled 
out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes66 and would have severe impacts on populations in low 
elevation  coastal  zones.  If global  warming  increases,  some compound  extreme  events67  will  become more 
frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent (high confidence). The 
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered 
scenarios (high confidence), however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 (medium confidence). If 
such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns 
and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human 
activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a 
low-likelihood  high-impact  event  that  would  lead  to  substantial  cooling  globally  and  regional  climate 
perturbations over several decades {WGI SPM B.5.3, WGI SPM C.3, WGI SPM C.3.1, WGI SPM C.3.2, WGI

3.2  Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits 

With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher 
levels of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will 
reach adaptation limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of 
adaptation. Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided 
by long-term planning and the implementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral 
and inclusive. (high confidence) 

The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and 
regions (high confidence) and will decrease with increasing warming (high confidence)68. For example, 
common  adaptation  responses  in  agriculture  –  adopting  improved  cultivars  and  agronomic  practices,  and 
changes  in  cropping  patterns  and  crop  systems  –  will  become  less  effective  from  2°C  to  higher  levels  of 
warming (high confidence). The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected 
risks declines with increasing warming (high confidence). Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric 
power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C–2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels 
of warming (medium confidence). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with 
effectiveness declining with increasing global warming (high confidence). Globally, adaptation options related 
to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, with a substantial increase in residual 
risk (medium confidence). {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.5, WGII SPM C.2.10, WGII 
Figure TS.6 Panel (e), 4.7.2}

potential impact. {WGI Box TS.1; WGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP}

68 There are limitations to assessing the full scope of adaptation options available in the future since not all possible future adaptation 
responses can be incorporated in climate impact models, and projections of future adaptation depend on currently available technologies 
or approaches. {WGII 4.7.2}

With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be reached (high confidence) and losses 
and  damages,  strongly  concentrated  among  the  poorest  vulnerable  populations,  will  increase  (high 
confidence).  Already  below  1.5°C,  autonomous  and  evolutionary  adaptation  responses  by  terrestrial  and 
aquatic ecosystems will increasingly face hard limits (high confidence) (Section 2.1.2). Above 1.5°C, some 
ecosystem-based  adaptation  measures  will  lose  their  effectiveness  in  providing  benefits  to  people  as  these 
ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits (high confidence). Adaptation to address the risks of heat stress, 
heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that 
become significantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates (high 
confidence). Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for 
Small Islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt (medium confidence). By 2°C, soft limits 
are projected for multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions (high confidence). By 3°C, soft limits 
are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of 
Europe (medium confidence). {WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM C.3.4, WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII 
TS.D.2.2, WGII TS.D.2.3; SR1.5 SPM B.6; SROCC SPM C.1} 

Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. For example, 
inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with 
effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster 
urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting adaptation options, such as disaster risk 
management,  early  warning  systems,  climate  services  and  risk  spreading  and  sharing  that  have  broad 
applicability  across  sectors  and  provide  greater  benefits  to  other  adaptation  options  when  combined. 
Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, primarily 
in  the  financial,  governance,  institutional  and  policy  domains,  can  help  overcome  soft  adaptation  limits. 
However,  adaptation  does  not  prevent  all  losses  and  damages,  even  with  effective  adaptation  and  before 
reaching soft and hard limits. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.6, WGII SPM.C.2.13, WGII 
SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM.C.3.4, WGII SPM C.3.5, WGII Figure TS.6 Panel (e)} 

Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that 
are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus on sectors 
and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become 
maladaptive due to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and decrease biodiversity 
and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating 
inequity.  Maladaptation  can  be  avoided  by  flexible,  multi-sectoral,  inclusive  and  long-term  planning  and 
implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {WGII 
SPM C.4, WGII SPM.C.4.1, WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM C.4.3} 

Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow 
onset  changes  and  increases  in  the  frequency  and  magnitude  of  extreme  sea  level  events  (high 
confidence). Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise (high 
confidence).  Responses  to  ongoing  sea  level  rise  and  land  subsidence  include  protection,  accommodation, 
advance  and  planned  relocation  (high  confidence).  These  responses  are more  effective  if  combined  and/or 
sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community 
engagement processes (high confidence). Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for 
the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences (medium confidence), but have 
site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC of global warming (high confidence) and lose effectiveness 
at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5–1 cm/yr (medium confidence). Seawalls can be maladaptive as they 
effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate 
risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan (high confidence). {WGI SPM

3.3  Mitigation Pathways 

Limiting  human-caused  global  warming  requires  net  zero  anthropogenic  CO2  emissions.  Pathways 
consistent with 1.5°C and 2°C carbon budgets imply rapid, deep, and in most cases immediate GHG 
emission  reductions  in  all  sectors  (high  confidence).  Exceeding  a  warming  level  and  returning  (i.e. 
overshoot) implies increased risks and potential irreversible impacts; achieving and sustaining global 
net negative CO2 emissions would reduce warming (high confidence). 

3.3.1  Remaining Carbon Budgets 

Limiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions 
to within a finite carbon budget69, along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 1000 GtCO2 
emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises by likely 0.27°C–0.63°C (best estimate of 0.45°C). 
This relationship implies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in order to limit warming 
to any given level. {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1; SR1.5 SPM C.1.3} (Figure 3.5) 

The  best  estimates  of  the  remaining  carbon  budget  (RCB)  from  the  beginning  of  2020  for  limiting 
warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood70 is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C (67% likelihood) this 
is 1150 GtCO2.71 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on the assessed value of TCRE and 
its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing 
permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net 
zero, as well as variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation action. The 
stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the 
larger RCB for the same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C 
with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 600 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 warming72. Limiting 
warming to 2°C with a 67% (or 83%) likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 (900) GtCO2 from the beginning 

69 See Annex 1: Glossary.  
70 This likelihood is based on the uncertainty in transient climate response to cumulative net CO2 emissions and additional Earth system 
feedbacks and provides the probability that global warming will not exceed the temperature levels specified. {WGI Table SPM.1} 
71 Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most 
countries  report  their  anthropogenic  land  CO2  fluxes  including  fluxes  due  to  human-caused  environmental  change  (e.g.,  CO2 
fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their National GHG inventories. Using emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining 
carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {WGIII SPM Footnote 9, WGIII TS.3, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 6} 
72 The central case RCB assumes future non-CO2 warming (the net additional contribution of aerosols and non-CO2 GHG) of around 
0.1°C above 2010–2019 in line with stringent mitigation scenarios. If additional non-CO2 warming is higher, the RCB for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood shrinks to around 300 GtCO2. If, however, additional non-CO2 warming is limited to only 
0.05°C  (via  stronger  reductions  of  CH4  and  N2O  through  a  combination  of  deep  structural  and  behavioural  changes,  e.g.,  dietary 
changes), the RCB could be around 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C warming. {WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Box TS.7; WGIII Box 3.4}

If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting 
cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and exhaust more 
than  a  third  of  the  remaining  carbon  budget  for  2°C  (67%)  (Figure  3.5).  Based  on  central  estimates  only, 
historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO2) amount to about four-
fifths74 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate 
about 2900 GtCO2) and to about two-thirds75 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global 
warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). {WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table

In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less 
effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence). While natural land and 
ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO2 under 
higher  compared  to  lower  CO2  emissions  scenarios,  they  become  less  effective,  that  is,  the  proportion  of 
emissions  taken  up  by  land  and  ocean  decreases  with  increasing  cumulative  net  CO2  emissions  (high 
confidence). Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as 
GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these 
gases in the atmosphere (high confidence). In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 
21st  century,  the  land  and  ocean  begin  to  take  up  less  carbon  in  response  to  declining  atmospheric  CO2 
concentrations (high confidence) and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions 
scenario (medium confidence)76. {WGI SPM B.4, WGI SPM B.4.1, WGI SPM B.4.2, WGI SPM B.4.3}

the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model  emulator. For the 
bracketed ranges in the “likelihood” column, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators 
(MAGICC and FaIR). These ranges cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate emulators’ uncertainty. All global warming levels 
are relative to 1850–1900.  
2 C3 pathways are sub-categorised according to the timing of policy action to match the emissions pathways in WGIII Figure SPM.4.  
3 Global emission reductions in mitigation pathways are reported on a pathway-by-pathway basis relative to harmonised modelled global emissions in 2019 rather 
than the global emissions reported in WGIII SPM Section B and WGIII Chapter 2; this ensures internal consistency in assumptions about emission sources and 
activities, as well as consistency with temperature projections based on the physical climate science assessment by WGI (see WGIII SPM Footnote 49). Negative 
values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent an increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53–58] GtCO2-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of 
estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO2-eq (see 2.1.1).  
4 Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Ranges in 
square brackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 
95th  percentile 5-year interval.  Numbers in  round  brackets signify the  fraction of  pathways that reach specific milestones over the 21st  century.  Percentiles

5 For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO2-eq defined by 
the 100-year global warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate 
response and the assignment to a climate category. Emissions pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. See WGIII 
Annex III.II.5.

3.3.2  Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications 

From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires 
limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong 
reductions of other GHG emissions (see Cross-Section Box 1). Global modelled pathways that reach and 
sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature (high 
confidence). Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other 
GHG emissions, and implies net-negative CO2 emissions77. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary 
to  achieve  net-negative  CO2  emissions78.  Achieving  global  net  zero  CO2  emissions,  with  remaining 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement 
to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase (see 3.3.3) (high confidence). This is different 
from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions (see Cross-
Section Box 1) equal CO2 removal (high confidence). Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG 
emissions  defined  by  the  100-year  global  warming  potential  imply  net-negative  CO2  emissions  and  are 
projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak (high confidence). While 
reaching net-zero CO2 or net-zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the 
deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, 
aviation, shipping, and industrial processes) is unavoidable (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM 
D.1.1, WGI SPM D.1.8; WGIII SPM C.2, WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.11, WGIII Box TS.6; SR1.5 SPM 
A.2.2} 

In  modelled  pathways,  the  timing  of  net-zero  CO2  emissions,  followed  by  net-zero  GHG  emissions, 
depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the 
gases covered (high confidence). Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%). While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit 
warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2-
eq/yr remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net 
zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs (high confidence). {WGIII SPM C.2, WGIII SPM C.2.3,

3.3.3  Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation 

All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 involve rapid and 
deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors (see also 4.1, 4.5). Reductions 
in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of 
energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers (see also 
4.5, Figure 4.4). Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use 
sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design 
and access. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.5, WGIII SPM C.6, WGIII SPM C.7.3, WGIII

Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning 
from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, 
such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing 
non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR.79. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, 
almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels 
with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet 
energy  service  demand  with  relatively  low  energy  use,  through  e.g.,  enhanced  energy  efficiency  and 
behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways 
limiting global warming to 2°C (>67%). (high confidence) {WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.3.2, WGIII SPM 
C.4, WGIII TS.4.2; SR1.5 SPM C.2.2} 

AFOLU  mitigation  options,  when  sustainably  implemented,  can  deliver  large-scale  GHG  emission 
reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result 
from  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  competing  demands  on  land,  conflicts  with  food  security  and 
livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects (see 3.4.1). 
All  assessed  modelled  pathways  that  limit  warming  to  2°C  (>67%)  or  lower  by  2100  include  land-based 
mitigation  and  land-use  change,  with  most including different combinations  of  reforestation,  afforestation, 
reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from 
future loss (or sink reversal) triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest 
outbreaks, or future poor management. (high confidence) {WGI SPM B.4.3; WGII SPM B.2.3, WGII SPM

SPM B.1.4, SRCCL SPM B.3, SRCCL SPM B.7} 

In  addition  to  deep,  rapid,  and  sustained  emission  reductions,  CDR  can  fulfil  three  complementary 
roles:  lowering  net  CO2  or  net  GHG  emissions  in  the  near  term;  counterbalancing  ‘hard-to-abate’ 
residual emissions  (e.g.,  some emissions from  agriculture,  aviation,  shipping,  industrial  processes) to 
help  reach  net  zero  CO2  or  GHG  emissions,  and  achieving  net  negative  CO2  or  GHG  emissions  if 
deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions (high confidence). CDR methods vary in terms of 
their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-
benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements (high confidence). Specifically, maturity ranges from 
lower maturity (e.g., ocean alkalinisation) to higher maturity (e.g., reforestation); removal and storage potential 
ranges from lower potential (<1 Gt CO2/yr, e.g., blue carbon management) to higher potential (>3 Gt CO2/yr, 
e.g., agroforestry); costs range from lower cost (e.g., –45 to 100 USD/tCO2 for soil carbon sequestration) to 
higher cost (e.g., 100–300 USD/tCO2 for direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage) (medium confidence). 
Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and 
through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological 
formations (high confidence). Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil 
carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods (high confidence). Methods and 
levels  of  CDR  deployment  in  global  modelled  mitigation  pathways  vary  depending  on  assumptions  about 
costs, availability and constraints (high confidence). {WGIII SPM C.3.5, WGIII SPM C.11.1, WGIII SPM 
C.11.4} 

79  CCS  is  an  option  to  reduce  emissions  from  large-scale  fossil-based  energy  and  industry  sources  provided  geological  storage  is 
available.  When  CO2  is  captured  directly  from  the  atmosphere  (DACCS),  or  from  biomass  (BECCS),  CCS  provides  the  storage 
component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil 
recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, 
where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which 
is  more  than  the  CO2  storage  requirements  through  2100  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5°C,  although  the  regional  availability  of 
geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that 
the  CO2  can  be  permanently  isolated  from  the  atmosphere.  Implementation  of  CCS  currently  faces  technological,  economic, 
institutional, ecological environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in 
modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support 
and technological innovation could reduce these barriers. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM C.4.6}

3.3.4  Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other Implications 

Exceeding  a  specific  remaining  carbon  budget  results  in  higher  global  warming.  Achieving  and 
sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance (high 
confidence). Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak 
temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming (high confidence). Only a small number of 
the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) without overshoot. {WGI 
SPM D.1.1, WGI SPM D.1.6, WGI SPM D.1.7; WGIII TS.4.2} 

Overshoot  of  a  warming  level  results  in  more  adverse  impacts,  some  irreversible,  and  additional  risks  for 
human  and  natural  systems  compared  to  staying  below  that  warming  level,  with  risks  growing  with  the 
magnitude and duration of overshoot (high confidence). Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies 
and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as 
extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, 
and associated livelihoods (high confidence). Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts 
on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-
sheet  glacier  melt,  or  by  accelerating  and  higher  committed  sea  level  rise  (high  confidence).  Overshoot 
increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, 
thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs 
making temperature reversal more challenging (medium confidence). {WGI SPM C.2, WGI SPM C.2.1, WGI 
SPM C.2.3; WGII SPM B.6, WGII SPM B.6.1, WGII SPM B.6.2; SR1.5 3.6} 

The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level (high 
confidence).  Reducing  global  temperature  by  removing  CO2  would  require  net  negative  emissions  of  220 
GtCO2 (best estimate, with a likely range 160-370 GtCO2) for every tenth of a degree (medium confidence). 
Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot reach median values of 
cumulative net-negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) 
after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2 (high confidence).80 More rapid reduction in CO2 and 
non-CO2  emissions,  particularly  methane,  limits  peak  warming  levels  and  reduces  the  requirement  for  net 
negative  CO2  emissions  and  CDR,  thereby  reducing  feasibility  and sustainability  concerns, and  social  and 
environmental risks (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.1; WGIII SPM B.6.4, WGIII SPM C.2, WGIII SPM

3.4  Long-Term Interactions Between Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development 

Mitigation and adaptation can lead to synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development (high 
confidence).  Accelerated  and  equitable  mitigation  and  adaptation  bring  benefits  from  avoiding 
damages from climate change and are critical to achieving sustainable development (high confidence). 
Climate  resilient  development81  pathways  are  progressively  constrained  by  every  increment  of 
further warming (very high confidence). There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a 
liveable and sustainable future for all (very high confidence). 

3.4.1  Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits 

Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable 
development (see also Section 4.6, Figure 4.4). Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude 
of  changes  and  the  development  context  including  inequalities,  with  consideration  of  climate  justice.  The 
potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies 
(see also Sections 3.2, 3.3.3, 4.5). (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII Figure SPM.4b; WGIII SPM D.1,

In  the  energy  sector,  transitions  to  low-emission  systems  will  have  multiple  co-benefits,  including 
improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, 
for  instance,  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy.  (high  confidence)  {WGIII  SPM  C.4.2,  WGIII  SPM 
D.1.3} 

For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options 
(e.g., dietary choices, reduced post-harvest losses, reduced food waste) can contribute to eradicating poverty 
and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation, and life on 
land (medium confidence). In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, 
such  as  irrigation,  may  have  negative  effects  on  sustainability  (e.g.,  for  biodiversity,  ecosystem  services, 
groundwater depletion, and water quality) (high confidence). {WGII TS.D.5.5; WGIII SPM D.10; SRCCL

Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue 
carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, 
employment and local livelihoods, depending on context.82 However, afforestation or production of biomass 
crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and 
environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of 
Indigenous  Peoples,  especially  if  implemented  at  large  scales  and  where  land  tenure  is  insecure.  (high

Modelled  pathways  that  assume  using  resources  more  efficiently  or  shift  global  development  towards 
sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, 
and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development (high confidence). {WGIII 
SPM C.3.6; SR1.5 SPM D.4.2}  

Strengthening  climate  change  mitigation  action  entails  more  rapid  transitions  and  higher  up-front 
investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation 
costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP (excluding damages from climate 
change  and  adaptation  costs)  are  small  compared  to  global  projected  GDP  growth.  Projected  estimates  of 
global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming 
level.  (high  confidence)  {WGII  SPM  B.4.6,  WGII  TS.C.10;  WGIII  SPM  C.12.2,  WGIII  SPM  C.12.3}  

Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including 
non-monetary  damages,  or  to  capture  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  damages  and  the  risk  of  catastrophic 
damages (high confidence). Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the 
global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation (medium confidence). This finding is 
robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time 
(medium confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, 
but  also  increase  the  benefits  in  terms  of  reduced  impacts  and  related  risks  (see  3.1.1,  3.1.2)  and  reduced 
adaptation  needs  (high  confidence)83.  {WGII  SPM  B.4,  WGII  SPM  B.6;  WGIII  SPM  C.12,  WGIII  SPM

Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on 
human  health  from  air  quality  improvement,  may  enhance  the  estimated  benefits  of  mitigation  (medium

depending  notably  on  economic  structure,  regional  emissions  reductions,  policy  design  and  level  of

disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions (Section 4.2), equity (Section

3.4.2  Advancing Integrated Climate Action for Sustainable Development 

An inclusive, equitable approach to integrating adaptation, mitigation and development can advance 
sustainable development in the long term (high confidence). Integrated responses can harness synergies for 
sustainable development and reduce trade-offs (high confidence)}. Shifting development pathways towards 
sustainability and advancing climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the 
private sector make development choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-
making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes (very 
high  confidence)  (see  also  Figure  4.2).  Inclusive  processes  involving  local  knowledge  and  Indigenous 
Knowledge increase these prospects (high confidence). However, opportunities for action differ substantially 
among and within regions, driven by historical and ongoing patterns of development (very high confidence). 
Accelerated financial support for developing countries is critical to enhance mitigation and adaptation action 
(high confidence). {WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.1.2, WGII SPM D.2,

Policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available 
mitigation  and  adaptation  responses  (medium  confidence).  Combining  mitigation  with  action  to  shift 
development  pathways,  such  as  broader  sectoral  policies,  approaches  that  induce  lifestyle  or  behaviour 
changes, financial regulation, or macroeconomic policies can overcome barriers and open up a broader range 
of mitigation options (high confidence). Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday decision-
making  about  urban  infrastructure  can  significantly  increase  the  adaptive  capacity  of  urban  and  rural 
settlements. Coastal cities and settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient development 
due  to  the  high  number  of  people  living  in  the  Low  Elevation  Coastal  Zone,  the  escalating  and  climate 
compounded  risk  that  they  face,  and  their  vital  role  in  national  economies  and  beyond  (high  confidence). 
{WGII SPM.D.3, WGII SPM D.3.3; WGIII SPM E.2, WGIII SPM E.2.2; SR1.5 SPM D.6} 

Observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, trends in vulnerability, and 
adaptation limits demonstrate that transformation for sustainability and climate resilient development 
action is more  urgent than  previously assessed  (very  high confidence).  Climate resilient  development 
integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient 
development  pathways have  been constrained by  past  development,  emissions  and  climate  change  and  are 
progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C (very high confidence). 
Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 
2°C  (medium  confidence).  Safeguarding  biodiversity  and  ecosystems  is  fundamental  to  climate  resilient 
development,  but  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services  have  limited  capacity  to  adapt  to  increasing  global 
warming  levels,  making  climate  resilient  development  progressively  harder  to  achieve  beyond  1.5°C 
warming (very high confidence). {WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.4, WGII SPM D.4.3,

The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and 
planetary health (very high confidence). Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on 
adaptation  and  mitigation  will  miss  a  brief  and  rapidly  closing  window  of  opportunity  to  secure  a 
liveable  and  sustainable  future  for  all  (very  high  confidence).  Opportunities  for  near-term  action  are

Section 4: Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate 

4.1  The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action 

Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation reduces the risks 
of climate change for humans and ecosystems. In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) with  no or  limited  overshoot  and in  those  that limit warming to  2°C  (>67%)  and assume 
immediate action, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid 
and  deep  reductions.  As  adaptation  options  often  have  long  implementation  times,  accelerated 
implementation of adaptation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps. (high 
confidence) 

The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation 
and  adaptation  actions  (very  high  confidence).  Global  warming  is  more  likely  than  not  to  reach  1.5°C 
between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9), and likely or very likely 
to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios84. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility 
up to 1.5°C (medium to high confidence, depending on option), but hard limits to adaptation have already been 
reached  in  some  ecosystems  and  the  effectiveness  of  adaptation  to  reduce  climate  risk  will  decrease  with 
increasing warming (high confidence). Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the 
extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development 
(high confidence). Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas 
emissions  do  not  rapidly  decline,  especially  if  1.5°C  global  warming  is  exceeded  in  the  near-term  (high 
confidence).  Without  urgent,  effective  and  equitable  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions,  climate  change 
increasingly  threatens  the  health  and  livelihoods  of  people  around  the  globe,  ecosystem  health,  and 
biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations (high confidence). {WGI 
SPM B.1.3, WGI SPM B.5.1, WGI SPM B.5.2; WGII SPM A, WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM 
C.3.3, WGII Figure SPM.4, WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM D.5, WGIII SPM D.1.1 SR1.5 SPM D.2.2}. (Cross-
Section Box.2, Figure 2.1, Figure 2.3) 

In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and in those 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to 
peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions (high confidence) 85. In 
pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are 
projected to fall by 43% [34–60%]86 below 2019 levels by 2030,60% [49–77%] by 2035, 69% [58-90%] by 
2040 and 84% [73-98%] (high confidence) (Section 2.3.1, Table 2.2, Figure 2.5, Table 3.1)87. Global modelled 
pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21% [1–
42]%  by  2030,  35%  [22–55%]  by  2035,  46%  [34-63%]  by  2040  and  64%  [53-77%]  by  2050  88(high 
confidence). Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely 
that warming would exceed 1.5°C (high confidence) and limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) would then imply a 
rapid  acceleration  of  emission  reductions  during  2030–2050,  around  70%  faster  than  in  pathways  where 
immediate action is taken to limit warming  to 2°C (>67%) (medium confidence) (Section 2.3.1) Continued 
investments  in  unabated  high-emitting  infrastructure89  and  limited  development  and  deployment  of  low-
emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks (high 
confidence). {WGIII SPM B.6.3, WGIII Chapter 3.5.2, WGIII SPM B.6, WGIII SPM B.6., WGIII SPM C.1, 
WGIII SPM C1.1, Table SPM.2} (Cross-Section Box.2) 

84In the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is  very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0), more likely 
than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low 
GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). The best estimates [and very likely ranges] of global warming for the different scenarios in the 
near-term  are:  1.5°C  [1.2°C–1.7°C]  (SSP1-1.9); 1.5°C  [1.2°C–1.8°C]  (SSP1-2.6); 1.5°C  [1.2°C–1.8°C]  (SSP2-4.5);  1.5°C  [1.2°C–

All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 involve reductions in

All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission 
reductions  in  all  sectors  (high  confidence).  The  contributions  of  different  sectors  vary  across  modelled 
mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change 
and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 
emissions  earlier  than  the  buildings,  industry  and  transport  sectors  (Figure  4.1).  Strategies  can  rely  on 
combinations  of  different  options  (Figure  4.1,  Section  4.5),  but  doing  less  in  one  sector  needs  to  be 
compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM

4.2  Benefits of Strengthening Near-Term Action  

Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, 
especially  for  vulnerable  populations.  Deep,  rapid  and  sustained  mitigation  actions  would  reduce 
future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid 
locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-
term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by 
a range of enabling conditions and removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility. (high confidence) 

Accelerated  implementation  of  adaptation  responses  will  bring  benefits  to  human  well-being  (high 
confidence) (Section 4.3).  As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning 
and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising 
that constraints remain for some regions. The benefits to vulnerable populations would be high (see Section 
4.4). (high confidence) {WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI SPM B.2.2, WGI SPM B.3; WGII SPM C.1.1, 
WGII  SPM  C.1.2,  WGII  SPM  C.2,  WGII  SPM  C.3.1,  WGII  SPM  Figure  SPM.4b;  SROCC  SPM  C.3.4, 
SROCC Figure 3.4, SROCC SPM Figure 5} 

Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses 
and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming 
levels, but cannot eliminate them all (very high confidence). The magnitude and rate of climate change and 
associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts 
and  related  losses  and  damages  escalate  with  every  increment  of  global  warming  (very  high  confidence). 
Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which will decrease the effectiveness of many 
adaptation  options,  including  Ecosystem-based  Adaptation  and  many  water-related  options,  as  well  as 
increasing  mitigation  feasibility  risks,  such  as  for  options  based  on  ecosystems  (high  confidence).  
Comprehensive,  effective,  and  innovative  responses  integrating  adaptation  and  mitigation  can  harness 
synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, as well as in meeting requirements for 
financing (very high confidence) (see Section 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9) {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII

D.2, WGIII SPM E.13, SR1.5 SPM C.2.7, SR1.5 D.1.3, SR1.5 D.5.2}. 

Mitigation actions will have other sustainable development co-benefits (high confidence). Mitigation will 
improve air quality and human health in the near-term notably because many air pollutants are co-emitted by 
GHG emitting sectors and because methane emissions leads to surface ozone formation (high confidence) The 
benefits from air quality improvement include prevention of air pollution-related premature deaths, chronic 
diseases  and  damages  to  ecosystems  and  crops.  The  economic  benefits  for  human  health  from  air  quality 
improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and 
potentially even larger (medium confidence). As methane has a short lifetime but is a potent GHG, strong, 
rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term warming and improve air quality by 
reducing global surface ozone (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI SPM D.2.2, WGI Chapter 6.7, WGI

Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions include the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of 
infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation 
options (high confidence). The continued installation of unabated fossil fuel91 infrastructure will ‘lock-
in’ GHG  emissions  (high  confidence).  Limiting  global  warming  to  2°C  or  below  will  leave  a substantial 
amount of fossil fuels unburned and could strand considerable fossil fuel infrastructure (high confidence), with 
globally discounted value projected to be around USD1–4 trillion from 2015 to 2050 (medium confidence). 
Early actions would limit the size of these stranded assets, whereas delayed actions with continued investments 
in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives 
prior to 2030 would raise future stranded assets to the higher end of the range – acting as barriers and increase 
political  economy  feasibility  risks  that  may  jeopardise  efforts  to  limit  global  warming  (high  confidence). 
{WGIII SPM B.6.3, WGIII SPM C.4, WGIII Box TS.8}.  

Scaling-up near-term climate actions (Section 4.1) will mobilise a mix of low-cost and high-cost options. 
High-cost options, as in energy and infrastructure, are needed to avoid future lock-ins, foster innovation and 
initiate  transformational  changes  (Figure  4.4).  Climate  resilient  development  pathways  in  support  of 
sustainable development for all are shaped by equity, and social and climate justice (very high confidence). 
Embedding  effective  and  equitable  adaptation  and  mitigation  in  development  planning  can  reduce 
vulnerability, conserve and restore ecosystems, and enable climate resilient development. This is especially 
challenging in localities with persistent development gaps and limited resources. (high confidence) {WGII 
SPM C.5, WGII SPM D1; WGIII TS.5.2, WGIII Section 8.3.1, WGIII Section 8.3.4, WGIII Section 8.4.1,

Scaling-up climate action may generate disruptive changes in economic structure with distributional 
consequences  and  need  to  reconcile  divergent  interests,  values  and  worldviews,  within  and  between 
countries. Deeper fiscal, financial, institutional and regulatory reforms can offset such adverse effects and 
unlock mitigation potentials. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade will determine the extent

Enabling conditions would need to be strengthened in the near-term and barriers reduced or removed 
to  realise  opportunities  for  deep  and  rapid  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions  and  climate  resilient 
development  (high  confidence)  (Figure  4.2).  These  enabling  conditions  are  differentiated  by  national, 
regional  and  local  circumstances  and  geographies,  according  to  capabilities,  and  include:  equity  and  and 
inclusion  in  climate  action  (see  Section  4.4),  rapid  and  far-reaching  transitions  in  sectors  and  system  (see 
Section 4.5), measures to achieve synergies and reduce trade-offs with sustainable development goals (see 
Section 4.6), governance and policy improvements (see Section 4.7), access to finance, improved international 
cooperation  and  technology  improvements  (see  Section  4.8),  and  integration  of  near-term  actions  across 
sectors, systems and regions (see Section 4.9). {WGII SPM D.2, WGIII SPM E.1, WGIII SPM E.2} 

Barriers to feasibility would need to be reduced or removed to deploy mitigation and adaptation options 
at scale. Many limits to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome by addressing a range of 
barriers,  including  economic,  technological,  institutional,  social,  environmental  and  geophysical.  The 
feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  options  increase  with  integrated,  multi-sectoral  solutions  that  differentiate 
responses  based  on  climate  risk,  cut  across  systems  and  address  social  inequities.  Strengthened  near-term 
actions in modelled cost-effective pathways that limit global warming to 2°C or lower, reduce the overall risk 
to the feasibility of the system transitions, compared to modelled pathways with delayed or uncoordinated 
action. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.5; WGIII SPM E.1, WGIII SPM

Figure 4.2: The illustrative development pathways (red to green) and associated outcomes (right panel) show that there 
is  a  rapidly  narrowing  window  of  opportunity  to  secure  a  liveable  and  sustainable  future  for  all.  Climate  resilient 
development is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable 
development.  Diverging pathways illustrate  that interacting choices and actions made by diverse government,  private 
sector  and  civil  society  actors  can  advance  climate  resilient  development,  shift  pathways  towards  sustainability,  and 
enable lower emissions and adaptation. Diverse knowledges and values include cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, 
local knowledge, and scientific knowledge. Climatic and non-climatic events, such as droughts, floods or pandemics, 
pose more severe shocks to pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways with 
higher climate resilient development (green). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and 
natural systems at global warming of 1.5°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The 
development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic development impact GHG emissions and hence shape 
mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for action 
are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed, dashed pathway), and enabling and constraining 
conditions (left panel), and take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. The longer

4.3  Near-Term Risks  

Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term 
with  increasing  global  warming  (high  confidence).  Multiple  climatic  and  non-climatic  risks  will 
interact,  resulting  in  increased  compounding  and  cascading  impacts  becoming  more  difficult  to 
manage (high confidence). Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming (very 
high  confidence),  while  strongly  concentrated  among  the  poorest  vulnerable  populations  (high 
confidence). Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure 
and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards (high confidence).  

Global  warming  will  continue  to  increase  in  the  near  term  (2021–2040)  mainly  due  to  increased 
cumulative  CO2  emissions  in  nearly  all  considered  scenarios  and  pathways.  In  the  near  term,  every 
region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards (medium to high confidence, 
depending  on  region  and  hazard),  increasing  multiple  risks  to  ecosystems  and  humans  (very  high 
confidence). In the near-term, natural variability92 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or 
amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. 
Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single 
year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global 
surface  temperature  in  any  individual  year  could  exceed  1.5oC  relative  to  1850–1900  with  a  probability 
between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). The occurrence of 
individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global 
warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near-term93 , it 
would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature 
and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years (medium confidence). {WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI 
SPM B.1.4, WGI SPM C.1, WGI SPM C.2, WGI Cross-Section Box TS.1, WGI Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; WGII 
SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.3.1; WGIII Box SPM.1 Figure 1}. 

The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, 
level of socio-economic development and adaptation (high confidence). In the near-term, many climate-
associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability 
and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios (high confidence). Future 
exposure  to  climatic  hazards  is  increasing  globally  due  to  socio-economic  development  trends  including 
growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure (high confidence). Urbanisation 
increases hot extremes (very high confidence) and precipitation runoff intensity (high confidence). Increasing 
urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow 
events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks (high confidence) (Figure 4.3). Vulnerability will also rise 
rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise (high confidence) 
(see  Figure  3.4  and  Figure  4.3).  Human  vulnerability  will  concentrate  in  informal  settlements  and  rapidly 
growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and 

92 See Annex I: Glossary. The main internal variability phenomena include El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Variability 
and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability through their regional influence {WGI SPM footnote 37}. The internal variability of global 
surface temperature in any single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence) {WGI SPM footnote 29}. 
93 Based on 2500-year reconstructions, eruptions with a radiative forcing more negative than -1 Wm-2, related to the radiative effect of 
volcanic stratospheric aerosols in the literature assessed in this report, occur on average twice per century. {WGI SPM footnote 38}

high  reliance  on  climate-sensitive  livelihoods  (high  confidence).  Human  and  ecosystem  vulnerability  are 
interdependent (high confidence). Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced 
by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and 
production,  increasing  demographic  pressures,  and  persistent  unsustainable  use  and  management  of  land, 
ocean,  and  water  (high  confidence).  Several  near-term  risks  can  be  moderated  with  adaptation  (high

Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near-term (at 1.5°C global warming) are: 

● 

● 

Increased  intensity  and  frequency  of  hot  extremes  and  dangerous  heat-humidity  conditions,  with 
increased  human  mortality,  morbidity,  and  labour  productivity  loss  (high  confidence)  {WGI  SPM

Increasing  frequency  of  marine  heatwaves  will  increase  risks  of  biodiversity  loss  in  the  oceans, 
including from mass mortality events (high confidence) {WGI SPM B.2.3; WGII SPM B.1.2, WGII

●  Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems (medium confidence)

sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence) and warm-water coral reefs (very high confidence) 
{WGII SPM B.3.1}.  

●  More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal

speeds of intense tropical cyclones (high confidence) {WGI SPM B.2.4, WGI SPM C.2.2, WGI SPM

●  High  risks  from  dryland  water  scarcity,  wildfire  damage,  and  permafrost  degradation  (medium

●  Continued  sea  level  rise  and  increased  frequency  and  magnitude  of  extreme  sea  level  events 
encroaching  on  coastal  human  settlements  and  damaging  coastal  infrastructure  (high  confidence), 
committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss (medium confidence), expanding 
land  salinization (very  high  confidence),  with  cascading  to risks  to livelihoods,  health,  well-being, 
cultural values, food and water security (high confidence) (Figure 3.4, 4.3). {WGI SPM C.2.5, WGI

●  Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near- to long-term

vector-borne disease risks (high confidence), and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress 
(very high confidence). {WGII SPM B.4.4} 

●  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to 
severe  consequences  for  people,  infrastructure  and  the  economy  in  most  mountain  regions  (high

●  The  projected  increase  in  frequency  and  intensity  of  heavy  precipitation  (high  confidence)  will 
increase rain-generated local flooding (medium confidence). {WGI Figure SPM.6; WGI SPM B.2.2;

Multiple  climate  change  risks  will  increasingly  compound  and  cascade  in  the  near  term  (high 
confidence). Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with 
higher global warming (high confidence) including concurrent heatwaves and drought.  Risks to health and 
food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat 
and  drought, exacerbated  by  heat-induced  labour  productivity losses  (high  confidence)  (Figure 4.3).  These 
interacting  impacts  will  increase  food  prices,  reduce  household  incomes,  and  lead  to  health  risks  of 
malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions 
(high confidence). Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, 
infrastructure  and  health  will  make  these risks  more severe  and more  difficult to  manage,  including  when 
interacting  with  non-climatic  risk  drivers  such  as  competition  for  land  between  urban  expansion  and  food 
production, and pandemics (high confidence). Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-
term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly 
dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs (high confidence). Increasing transboundary risks are projected

including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide

4.4  Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  

Actions  that  prioritise  equity,  climate  justice, social  justice  and  inclusion lead  to  more  sustainable 
outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient 
development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially 
for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and 
deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation. (high confidence) 

Adaptation  and  mitigation  actions,  across  scales,  sectors  and  regions,  that  prioritise  equity,  climate 
justice,  rights-based  approaches,  social  justice  and  inclusivity,  lead  to  more  sustainable  outcomes, 
reduce  trade-offs,  support  transformative  change  and  advance  climate  resilient  development  (high 
confidence). Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable,,  social 
safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve 
trade-offs  with  sustainable  development goals.(SDGs),  particularly  education,  hunger, poverty, gender  and 
energy  access  (high  confidence).  Mitigation  efforts  embedded  within  the  wider  development  context  can 
increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions (medium confidence). Equity, inclusion and just 
transitions at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more 
broadly (high confidence). The complexity in risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health 
and climate-related malnutrition (particularly maternal malnutrition and child undernutrition) and mortality 
increases with little or low levels of adaptation (high confidence). {WGII SPM B.5.1, WGII SPM C.2.9, WGII 
SPM D.2.1, WGII TS Box TS.4; WGIII SPM D.3, WGIII SPM D.3.3, WGIII SPM WGIII SPM E.3, SR1.5 
SPM D.4.5} (Figure 4.3c) 

Regions  and  people  with  considerable  development  constraints  have  high  vulnerability  to  climatic 
hazards.  Adaptation  outcomes  for  the  most  vulnerable  within  and  across  countries  and  regions  are 
enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 
3.3 to 3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence). 
Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services 
and  resources,  violent  conflict  and  high  levels  of  climate-sensitive  livelihoods  (e.g.,  smallholder  farmers, 
pastoralists, fishing communities) (high confidence). Several risks can be moderated with adaptation (high 
confidence). The largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups (high confidence) and 
adaptation  progress  is  unevenly  distributed  with  observed  adaptation  gaps  (high  confidence).  Present 
development  challenges  causing  high  vulnerability  are  influenced  by  historical  and  ongoing  patterns  of 
inequity  such  as  colonialism,  especially  for  many  Indigenous  Peoples  and  local  communities  (high 
confidence).  Vulnerability  is  exacerbated  by  inequity  and  marginalisation  linked  to  gender,  ethnicity,  low 
income  or  combinations  thereof,  especially  for  many  Indigenous  Peoples  and  local  communities  (high 
confidence). {WGII SPM B.2, WGII SPM B.2.4, WGII SPM B.3.2, WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM C.1, WGII

Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, 
local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation 
(high confidence). Such actions with flexible pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions (very 
high confidence). Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers 
and  public  works programmes,  would  increase  resilience to climate  change,  especially  when  supported  by 
basic services and infrastructure (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.3, WGII SPM C.4.3, WGII SPM C.4.4,

Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision 
making at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more

burdens (high confidence). Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding 
shifts  in  differentiation  between  states  over  time  and  challenges  in  assessing  fair  shares.  Ambitious 
mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with significant 
distributional  consequences,  within  and  between  countries,  including  shifting  of  income  and  employment 
during the transition from high to low emissions activities (high confidence). While some jobs may be lost, 
low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance skills and create jobs (high confidence). 
Broadening  equitable  access  to  finance,  technologies  and  governance  that  facilitate  mitigation,  and 
consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of benefits and burdens, especially for vulnerable 
countries and communities.  {WGIII  SPM  D.3, WGIII  SPM  D.3.2,  WGIII  SPM  D.3.3, WGIII  SPM  D.3.4, 
WGIII TS Box TS.4} 

Development priorities among countries also reflect different starting points and contexts, and enabling 
conditions  for  shifting  development  pathways  towards  increased  sustainability  will  therefore  differ, 
giving rise to different needs (high confidence). Implementing just transition principles through collective 
and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of integrating equity principles into policies 
at all scales depending on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition commissions, task 
forces and  national  policies  have  been  established  (medium confidence).  {WGIII  SPM  D.3.1,  WGIII  SPM 
D.3.3} 

Many  economic  and  regulatory  instruments  have  been  effective  in  reducing  emissions  and  practical 
experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and 
social acceptance (high confidence). The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices 
are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective 
(medium confidence). Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, 
and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, 
and professionals (high confidence). There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, 
and  consumption-based  approaches,  complemented  by  regulatory  instruments  to  reduce  high-emissions 
consumption  while  improving  equity  and  societal  well-being  (high  confidence).  Behaviour  and  lifestyle 
changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and 
technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being (high confidence). Broadening equitable access 
to  domestic  and  international finance,  technologies and  capacity  can  also act  as  a  catalyst  for  accelerating 
mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts (high confidence). Eradicating extreme 
poverty,  energy  poverty,  and  providing  decent  living  standards  to  all  in  these  regions  in  the  context  of 
achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near-term, can be achieved without significant global 
emissions growth (high confidence). Technology development, transfer, capacity building and financing can 
support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems thereby 
providing multiple co-benefits (high confidence). Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work 
in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward equitable 
and just outcomes (high confidence) {WGII D.2.1, WGIII SPM B.3.3, WGIII SPM.C.8.5, WGIII SPM C.10.2,

4.5  Near-Term Mitigation and Adaptation Actions  

Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and 
sustained  emissions  reductions  and  secure  a  liveable  and  sustainable  future  for  all.  These  system 
transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. 
Feasible,  effective  and  low-cost  options  for  mitigation  and  adaptation  are  already  available,  with 
differences across systems and regions. (high confidence) 

Rapid  and  far-reaching  transitions  across  all  sectors  and  systems  are  necessary  to  achieve  deep 
emissions  reductions  and  secure  a  liveable  and  sustainable  future  for  all  (high  confidence).  System 
transitions94 consistent with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot are 
more rapid and pronounced in the near-term than in those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (high confidence). 
Such a systemic change is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed (medium 
confidence). The system transitions make possible the transformative adaptation required for high levels of 
human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health, and planetary health. {WGII 
SPM A, WGII SPM Figure SPM.1; WGIII SPM C.3; SR1.5 SPM C.2, SR1.5 SPM C.2.1, SR1.5 SPM C.2, 
SR1.5 SPM C.5} 

Feasible,  effective  and  low-cost  options  for  mitigation  and  adaptation  are  already  available  (high 
confidence) (Figure 4.4). Mitigation options costing USD100 per tCO2-eq or less could reduce global GHG 
emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030 (options costing less than USD20 tCO2-eq–1 are estimated to 
make up more than half of this potential) (high confidence) (Figure 4.4). The availability, feasibility95 and 
potential of mitigation or effectiveness of adaptation options in the near-term differ across systems and regions 
(very high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2; WGIII SPM C.12, WGIII SPM E.1.1; SR1.5 SPM B.6}  

Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in 
end-use  sectors  by  40–70%  by  2050  compared  to  baseline  scenarios,  while  some  regions  and 
socioeconomic  groups  require  additional  energy  and  resources.  Demand-side  mitigation  encompasses 
changes in infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and behavioural change. (high 
confidence) (Figure 4.4) {WGIII SPM C.10}

Figure 4.4: Multiple Opportunities for scaling up climate action. Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation 
options across different systems. The left hand side of panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed 
for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As literature above 
1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. 
The  term  response  is  used  here  in  addition  to  adaptation  because  some  responses,  such  as  migration,  relocation  and 
resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, allows reduction 
of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest 
conservation and restoration, reforestation and afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility 
dimensions  (economic,  technological,  institutional,  social, environmental  and  geophysical)  were used  to  calculate  the 
potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential 
feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are 
identified as high, medium, and low. The right hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected mitigation options 
and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in 
the longer term compared to 2030. Costs are net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions 
calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net GHG emission reduction 
that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions 
are  the  sum  of  reduced  emissions  and/or  enhanced  sinks. The  baseline used  consists  of  current  policy  (around 2019) 
reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25/75 percentile values). The mitigation potentials are assessed 
independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in 
settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in 
industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length of the solid bars represents the 
mitigation  potential  of  an  option.  Potentials  are  broken  down  into  cost  categories,  indicated  by  different  colours (see 
legend).  Only  discounted  lifetime  monetary  costs  are  considered.  Where  a  gradual  colour  transition  is  shown,  the 
breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such as geographical 
location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty 
in the total potential is typically 25–50%. When interpreting this figure, the following should be taken into account: (1) 
The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) being displaced, the 
rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the 
cost aspects, which are not reflected in the figure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable 
energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included. 

Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on 
approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral 
mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by 
national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range 
in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. 
Food  shows  demand-side  potential  of  socio-cultural  factors  and  infrastructure  use,  and  changes  in  land-use  patterns 
enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global 
GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, 
while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-
side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected 
increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a 
bottom-up  assessment,  this  projected  increase  in  electricity  demand  can  be  avoided  through  demand-side  mitigation 
options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land 
transport, and buildings (green arrow).

4.5.1  Energy Systems 

Rapid  and  deep  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  require  major  energy  system  transitions  (high 
confidence). Adaptation options can help reduce climate-related risks to the energy system (very high 
confidence). Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal 
use of unabated fossil fuels96, and use of Carbon Capture and Storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; 

96 In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that  substantially reduce the 
amount of GHG emitted throughout the life cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50–80% of fugitive 
methane emissions from energy supply {WGIII SPM footnote 54}.

electricity systems that emit no net CO2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications 
less amenable to electrification; energy conservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy 
system (high confidence). Large contributions to emissions reductions can come from options costing less than 
USD20  tCO2-eq–1,  including  solar  and  wind  energy,  energy  efficiency  improvements,  and  CH4  (methane) 
emissions  reductions  (from  coal  mining,  oil  and  gas,  and  waste)  (medium  confidence).97  Many  of  these 
response  options  are  technically  viable  and  are  supported  by  the  public  (high  confidence).  Maintaining 
emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low 
emission systems (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2.10; WGIII SPM C.4.1, WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM 
C.12.1, WGIII SPM E.1.1, WGIII TS.5.1}.  

Climate  change  and  related  extreme  events  will  affect  future  energy  systems,  including  hydropower 
production, bioenergy yields, thermal power plant efficiencies, and demands for heating and cooling (high 
confidence).  The  most  feasible  energy  system  adaptation  options  support  infrastructure  resilience,  reliable 
power systems and efficient water use for existing and new energy generation systems (very high confidence). 
Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 
2°C,  with  decreasing  effectiveness  at  higher  levels  of  warming  (medium  confidence).  Energy  generation 
diversification (e.g., wind, solar, small-scale hydroelectric) and demand side management (e.g., storage and 
energy efficiency improvements) can increase energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change, 
especially in rural populations (high confidence). Climate responsive energy markets, updated design standards 
on  energy  assets  according  to  current  and  projected  climate  change,  smart-grid  technologies,  robust 
transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in the medium- 
to  long-term,  with  mitigation  co-benefits  (very  high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  B.5.3,  WGII  SPM  C.2.10; 
WGIII TS.5.1} 

4.5.2 

Industry  

There are several options to reduce industrial emissions that differ by type of industry; many industries 
are disrupted by climate change, especially from extreme events (high confidence). Reducing industry 
emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including 
demand  management,  energy  and  materials  efficiency,  circular  material  flows,  as  well  as  abatement 
technologies  and  transformational  changes  in  production  processes  (high  confidence).  Light  industry  and 
manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through available abatement technologies (e.g., material efficiency, 
circularity), electrification (e.g., electrothermal heating, heat pumps), and switching to low- and zero-GHG 
emitting fuels (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, and bio-based and other synthetic fuels) (high confidence), while 
deep reduction of cement process emissions will rely on cementitious material substitution and the availability 
of  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage  (CCS)  until  new  chemistries  are  mastered  (high  confidence).  Reducing 
emissions from the production and use of chemicals would need to rely on a life cycle approach, including 
increased plastics recycling, fuel and feedstock switching, and carbon sourced through biogenic sources, and, 
depending on availability, Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), direct air CO2 capture, as well as CCS (high 
confidence). Action to reduce industry sector emissions may change the location of GHG-intensive industries 
and  the  organisation  of  value  chains,  with  distributional  effects  on  employment  and  economic  structure 
(medium confidence).  {WGII  TS.B.9.1,  WGII  Chapter  16.5.2 WGIII  SPM  C.5,  WGIII  SPM  C.5.2,  WGIII 
SPM C.5.3, WGIII TS.5.5} 

Many industrial and service sectors are negatively affected by climate change through supply and operational 
disruptions,  especially  from  extreme  events  (high  confidence),  and  will  require  adaptation  efforts.  Water 
intensive industries (e.g., mining) can undertake measures to reduce water stress, such as water recycling and 
reuse, using brackish or saline sources, working to improve water use efficiency. However, residual risks will 
remain, especially at higher levels of warming (medium confidence). (Section 3.2) {WGII TS.B.9.1, WGII

4.5.3  Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure 

Urban  systems  are  critical  for  achieving  deep  emissions  reductions  and  advancing  climate  resilient 
development, particularly when this involves integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural 
and social infrastructure (high confidence). Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation actions are 
advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating 
jobs and housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; electrification in combination 
with  low  emissions  sources;  improved  water  and  waste  management  infrastructure;  and  enhancing  carbon 
uptake and storage in the urban environment (e.g. bio-based building materials, permeable surfaces and urban 
green  and  blue  infrastructure).  Cities  can  achieve  net-zero  emissions  if  emissions  are  reduced  within  and 
outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, creating beneficial cascading effects across 
other sectors. (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.5.6, WGII SPM D.1.3, WGII  SPM D.3; WGIII SPM C.6, 
WGIII SPM C.6.2, WGIII TS 5.4, SR1.5 SPM C.2.4} 

Considering climate change impacts and risks (e.g., through climate services) in the design and planning of 
urban  and  rural  settlements  and  infrastructure  is  critical  for  resilience  and  enhancing  human  well-being. 
Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for 
buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, low-emission construction 
materials,  highly  efficient  building  envelope  and  the  integration  of  renewable  energy  solutions;  at  the  use 
phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with 
low-emission  energy  sources;  and  at  the  disposal  phase,  recycling  and  re-using  construction  materials. 
Sufficiency98  measures  can  limit  the  demand  for  energy  and  materials  over  the  lifecycle  of  buildings  and 
appliances. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2.5; WGIII SPM C.7.2}.  

Transport-related  GHG  emissions  can  be  reduced  by  demand-side  options  and  low-GHG  emissions 
technologies. Changes in urban form, reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation (e.g., 
teleworking) and programs that encourage changes in consumer behaviour (e.g. transport, pricing) can reduce 
demand for transport services and support the shift to more energy efficient transport modes (high confidence). 
Electric  vehicles  powered by  low-emissions  electricity  offer the  largest decarbonisation  potential for  land-
based transport, on a life cycle basis (high confidence). Costs of electrified vehicles are decreasing and their 
adoption is accelerating, but they require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase scale 
of deployment (high confidence). The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns 
about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material 
efficiency improvements, and circular material flows (medium confidence). Advances in battery technologies 
could  facilitate  the  electrification  of  heavy-duty  trucks  and  compliment  conventional  electric  rail  systems 
(medium confidence). Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in 
the  short  and  medium  term  (medium  confidence).  Sustainable  biofuels,  low-emissions  hydrogen,  and 
derivatives (including synthetic fuels) can support mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and 
heavy-duty  land  transport  but  require  production  process  improvements  and  cost  reductions  (medium 
confidence).  Key  infrastructure  systems  including  sanitation,  water,  health,  transport,  communications  and 
energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions (high 
confidence) {WGII SPM B.2.5; WGIII SPM C.6.2, WGIII SPM C.8, WGIII SPM C.8.1, WGIII SPM C.8.2, 
WGIII SPM C.10.2, WGIII SPM C.10.3, WGIII SPM C.10.4}.  

Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration 
can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use 
while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing 
co-benefits  for  health,  wellbeing  and  livelihoods  (medium  confidence).  Urban  greening  can  provide  local 
cooling (very high confidence). Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses 
has  potential  to  reduce  adaptation  costs  and  contribute  to  flood  control,  sanitation,  water  resources 
management, landslide prevention and coastal protection (medium confidence). Globally, more financing is 
directed  at  grey/physical  infrastructure  than  green/natural  infrastructure  and  social  infrastructure  (medium 
confidence), and there is limited evidence of investment in informal settlements (medium to high confidence). 
The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising finance to reduce climate risk

Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small

4.5.4  Land, Ocean, Food, and Water 

There is substantial mitigation and adaptation potential from options in agriculture, forestry and other 
land use, and in the oceans, that could be upscaled in the near term across most regions (high confidence) 
(Figure 4.5). Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the 
largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical regions having the highest 
total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to trade-offs due to 
competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs required integrated approaches to meet multiple objectives 
including  food  security.  Demand-side  measures  (shifting  to  sustainable  healthy  diets  and  reducing  food 
loss/waste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion and CH4 and N2O 
emissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agriculture and 
forest products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in 
other  sectors.  Effective  adaptation  options  include  cultivar  improvements,  agroforestry,  community-based 
adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require 
integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. The effectiveness of ecosystem-based 
adaptation  and  most  water-related  adaptation  options  declines  with  increasing  warming  (see  3.2).  (high 
confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.2, WGII SPM C.2.5 WGIII SPM C.9.1; SRCCL SPM B.1.1, 
SRCCL SPM B.5.4, SRCCL SPM D.1; SROCC SPM C}  

Some  options,  such  as  conservation  of  high-carbon  ecosystems  (e.g.,  peatlands,  wetlands,  rangelands, 
mangroves and forests), have immediate impacts while others, such as restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, 
reclamation of degraded soils or afforestation, take decades to deliver measurable results (high confidence). 
Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are financially profitable in three to ten years 
(medium confidence). {SRCCL SPM B.1.2, SRCCL SPM D.2.2}  

Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective 
and  equitable  conservation  of  approximately  30–50%  of  Earth’s  land,  freshwater  and  ocean  areas, 
including  currently  near-natural  ecosystems  (high  confidence).  The  services  and  options  provided  by 
terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary 
ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors 
(high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.4, WGII SPM D.4; SROCC SPM C.2}  

Large-scale land conversion for bioenergy, biochar, or afforestation can increase risks to biodiversity, water 
and food security. In contrast, restoring natural forests and drained peatlands, and improving sustainability of 
managed forests enhances the resilience of carbon stocks and sinks and reduces ecosystem vulnerability to 
climate change. Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with local communities and Indigenous Peoples, 
as  well  as  recognition  of  inherent  rights  of  Indigenous  Peoples,  is  integral  to  successful  adaptation  across 
forests  and other  ecosystems. (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  B.5.4,  WGII  SPM  C.2.3, WGII  SPM  C.2.4;

Natural  rivers,  wetlands  and  upstream  forests  reduce  flood  risk  in  most  circumstances  (high  confidence). 
Enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, land use planning such as no build 
zones or upstream forest management, can further reduce flood risk (medium confidence). For inland flooding, 
combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have 
reduced loss of lives (medium confidence), but hard defences against flooding or sea level rise can also be 
maladaptive (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.4.1, WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM C.2.5}

Protection and restoration of coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass 
meadows) could reduce emissions and/or increase carbon uptake and storage (medium confidence). Coastal 
wetlands  protect  against  coastal  erosion  and  flooding  (very  high  confidence).  Strengthening  precautionary 
approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries, and responsiveness of existing fisheries 
management  strategies  reduces  negative  climate  change  impacts  on  fisheries,  with  benefits  for  regional

4.5.5  Health and Nutrition 

Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health 
into  food,  infrastructure,  social  protection,  and  water  policies  (very  high  confidence).  Balanced  and 
sustainable healthy diets99 and reduced food loss and waste present important opportunities for adaptation and 
mitigation  while  generating  significant  co-benefits  in  terms  of  biodiversity  and  human  health  (high 
confidence). Public health policies to improve nutrition, such as increasing the diversity of food sources in 
public procurement, health insurance, financial incentives, and awareness-raising campaigns, can potentially 
influence food demand, reduce food waste, reduce healthcare costs, contribute to lower GHG emissions and 
enhance adaptive capacity (high confidence). Improved access to clean energy sources and technologies, and 
shifts to active mobility (e.g., walking and cycling) and public transport can deliver socioeconomic, air quality 
and  health benefits,  especially  for  women and  children  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.2.2,  WGII  SPM

Effective adaptation options exist to help protect human health and wellbeing (high confidence). Health 
Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective for extreme heat (high confidence). 
Effective options for water-borne and food-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing 
exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and improved early warning 
systems (very high confidence). For vector-borne diseases, effective adaptation options include surveillance, 
early  warning  systems,  and  vaccine  development  (very  high  confidence).  Effective  adaptation  options  for 
reducing mental health risks under climate change include improving surveillance and access to mental health 
care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather events (high confidence). A key pathway 
to climate resilience in the health sector is universal access to healthcare (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.2.11,

4.5.6  Society, Livelihoods, and Economies 

Enhancing  knowledge  on  risks  and  available  adaptation  options  promotes  societal  responses,  and 
behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure and technology can help reduce 
global GHG emissions (high confidence). Climate literacy and information provided through climate services 
and community approaches, including those that are informed by Indigenous Knowledge and local knowledge, 
can accelerate behavioural changes and planning (high confidence). Educational and information programmes, 
using the arts, participatory modelling and citizen science can facilitate awareness, heighten risk perception, 
and influence behaviours (high confidence). The way choices are presented can enable adoption of low GHG 
intensive socio-cultural options, such as shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets, reduced food waste, and 
active  mobility  (high  confidence).  Judicious  labelling,  framing,  and  communication  of  social  norms  can 
increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes (medium confidence) {WGII SPM C.5.3, WGII TS.D.10.1;

A  range  of  adaptation  options,  such  as  disaster  risk  management,  early  warning  systems,  climate 
services and risk spreading and sharing approaches, have broad applicability across sectors and provide 
greater risk reduction benefits when combined (high confidence). Climate services that are demand-driven 
and inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and 
efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning (high confidence). Policy mixes that include weather 
and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and 
universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can reduce vulnerability 
and  exposure  of  human  systems  (high  confidence).  Integrating  climate  adaptation  into  social  protection 
programs, including cash transfers and public works programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to 
climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure (high confidence). Social safety 
nets  can  build  adaptive  capacities,  reduce  socioeconomic  vulnerability,  and  reduce  risk  linked  to  hazards 
(robust  evidence,  medium  agreement).  {WGII  SPM  C.2.9,  WGII  SPM  C.2.13,  WGII  Cross-Chapter  Box 
FEASIB in Chapter 18; SRCCL SPM C.1.4, SRCCL SPM D.1.2}.  

Reducing  future  risks  of  involuntary  migration  and  displacement  due  to  climate  change  is  possible 
through  cooperative,  international  efforts  to  enhance  institutional  adaptive  capacity  and  sustainable 
development  (high  confidence).  Increasing  adaptive  capacity  minimises  risk  associated  with  involuntary 
migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while 
policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly and regular migration 
that  allows  vulnerable  people  to  adapt  to  climate  change  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.2.12,  WGII 
TS.D.8.6, WGII Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7} 

Accelerating commitment and follow-through by the private sector is promoted for instance by building 
business  cases  for  adaptation,  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms,  and  monitoring  and 
evaluation of adaptation progress (medium confidence). Integrated pathways for managing climate risks 
will be most suitable when so-called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are established jointly across sectors in 
a  timely  manner  and  are  feasible  and  effective  in  their  local  context,  and  when  path  dependencies  and 
maladaptations across sectors are avoided (high confidence). Sustained adaptation actions are strengthened by 
mainstreaming adaptation into institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory planning, monitoring 
and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts from disaster events (high confidence). Instruments that 
incorporate adaptation such as policy and legal frameworks, behavioural incentives, and economic instruments 
that address market failures, such as climate risk disclosure, inclusive and deliberative processes strengthen 
adaptation actions by public and private actors (medium confidence). {WGII SPM C.5.1, WGII SPM C.5.2, 
WGII TS.D.10.4} 

4.6  Co-Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation for Sustainable Development Goals 

Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development 
Goals  (SDGs).  Synergies  and  trade-offs  depend  on  context  and  scale  of  implementation.  Potential 
trade-offs  can  be  compensated  or  avoided  with  additional  policies,  investments  and  financial 
partnerships. (high confidence) 

Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies with Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), but some actions can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed potential trade-
offs. Synergies and trade-offs are context specific and depend on: means and scale of implementation, intra- 
and  inter-sectoral  interactions,  cooperation  between  countries  and  regions,  the  sequencing,  timing  and 
stringency  of  actions,  governance,  and  policy  design.  Eradicating  extreme  poverty,  energy  poverty,  and 
providing decent living standards to all, consistent with near-term sustainable development objectives, can be 
achieved without significant global emissions growth. (high confidence) (Figure 4.5) {WGII SPM C.2.3, WGII 
SPM Figure SPM.4b; WGIII SPM B.3.3, WGIII SPM C.9.2, WGIII SPM D.1.2, WGIII SPM D.1.4, WGIII

Several  mitigation  and  adaptation  options  can  harness  near-term  synergies  and  reduce trade-offs  to 
advance  sustainable  development  in  energy,  urban  and  land  systems  (Figure  4.5)  (high  confidence). 
Clean energy supply systems have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. Heat

food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation benefit health and well-being. There are potential 
synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable land use and urban planning with 
more green spaces, reduced air pollution, and demand-side mitigation including shifts to balanced, sustainable 
healthy  diets.  Electrification  combined  with  low-GHG  energy,  and  shifts  to  public  transport  can  enhance 
health, employment, and can contribute to energy security and deliver equity. Conservation, protection and 
restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management to adapt 
to  unavoidable  impacts  of  climate  change  can  generate  multiple  additional  benefits,  such  as  agricultural 
productivity, food security, and biodiversity conservation. (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.1.1, WGII C.2.4, 
WGII SPM D.1, WGII SPM Figure SPM.4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 17, WGII Cross-
Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.4.2, WGIII SPM D.1.3, WGIII SPM D.2, WGIII SPM 
Figure SPM.8; SRCCL SPM B.4.6} 

When implementing mitigation and adaptation together, and taking trade-offs into account, multiple 
co-benefits and synergies for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health can be realised 
(high confidence). There is a strong link between sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks. 
Social safety nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such 
as education, poverty alleviation, gender inclusion and food security. Land restoration contributes to mitigation 
and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services and with economically positive returns and 
co-benefits for poverty reduction and improved livelihoods. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by 
giving emphasis  to  capacity  building,  finance,  technology  transfer, investments;  governance,  development, 
context  specific  gender-based  and  other  social  equity  considerations  with  meaningful  participation  of 
Indigenous  Peoples,  local  communities  and  vulnerable  populations.  (high  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.2.9,

Context  relevant  design  and  implementation  requires  considering  people’s  needs,  biodiversity,  and 
other  sustainable  development  dimensions  (very  high  confidence).  Countries  at  all  stages  of  economic 
development  seek  to  improve  the  well-being  of  people,  and  their  development  priorities  reflect  different 
starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but are not limited to social, economic, environmental, 
cultural,  or  political circumstances,  resource  endowment,  capabilities, international  environment,  and  prior 
development. n regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, among other things, revenue and employment 
generation, mitigating risks for sustainable development requires policies that promote economic and energy 
sector  diversification  and  considerations  of  just  transitions  principles,  processes  and  practices  (high 
confidence).  For  individuals  and  households  in  low-lying  coastal  areas,  in  Small  Islands,  and  smallholder 
farmers transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits 
(high confidence). Effective governance is needed to limit trade-offs of some mitigation options such as large 
scale afforestation and bioenergy options due to risks from their deployment for food systems, biodiversity, 
other  ecosystem  functions  and  services,  and  livelihoods  (high  confidence).  Effective  governance  requires 
adequate institutional capacity at all levels (high confidence) {WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM

4.7  Governance and Policy for Near-Term Climate Change Action 

Effective  climate  action  requires  political  commitment,  well-aligned  multi-level  governance  and 
institutional  frameworks,  laws,  policies  and  strategies.  It  needs  clear  goals,  adequate  finance  and 
financing  tools,  coordination  across  multiple  policy  domains,  and  inclusive  governance  processes. 
Many  mitigation  and  adaptation  policy  instruments  have  been  deployed  successfully,  and  could 
support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and applied widely, depending 
on  national  circumstances.  Adaptation  and  mitigation  action  benefits  from  drawing  on  diverse 
knowledge. (high confidence)  

Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation by providing overall direction based on 
national  circumstances,  setting  targets  and  priorities,  mainstreaming  climate  action  across  policy 
domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. 
Effective  governance  enhances  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  regulatory  certainty,  prioritising 
inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and technology 
(high confidence). These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws and plans, which are growing 
in  number  across  sectors  and  regions,  advancing  mitigation  outcomes  and  adaptation  benefits  (high 
confidence). Climate laws have been growing in number and have helped deliver mitigation and adaptation 
outcomes  (medium  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C.5,  WGII  SPM  C.5.1,  WGII  SPM  C5.4,  WGII  SPM  C.5.6; 
WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.3.1} 

Effective municipal,  national  and sub-national climate  institutions,  such  as  expert  and  co-ordinating 
bodies, enable co-produced, multi-scale decision-processes, build consensus for action among diverse 
interests, and inform strategy settings (high confidence). This requires adequate institutional capacity at all 
levels (high confidence). Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often reduced through carefully designed and 
implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that address context specific inequities 
such as based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income (high confidence). Policy support is 
influenced by Indigenous Peoples, businesses, and actors in civil society, including, youth, labour, media, and 
local communities, and effectiveness is enhanced by partnerships between many different groups in society 
(high  confidence).Climate-related  litigation  is  growing,  with  a  large  number  of  cases  in  some  developed 
countries and with a much smaller number in some developing countries, and in some cases has influenced the

outcome  and  ambition  of  climate  governance  (medium  confidence).  {WGII  SPM  C2.6,  WGII  SPM  C.5.2, 
WGII SPM C.5.5, WGII SPM C.5.6, WGII SPM D.3.1; WGIII SPM E3.2, WGIII SPM E.3.3} 

Effective  climate  governance  is  enabled  by  inclusive  decision  processes,  allocation  of  appropriate 
resources, and institutional review, monitoring and evaluation (high confidence). Multi-level, hybrid and 
cross-sector governance facilitates appropriate consideration for co-benefits and trade-offs, particularly in land 
sectors where decision processes range from farm level to national scale (high confidence). Consideration of 
climate justice can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability. {WGII SPM C.5.5, 
WGII SPM C.5.6, WGII SPM D.1.1, WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.2; SRCCL SPM C.3, SRCCL TS.1} 

Drawing  on  diverse  knowledge  and  partnerships,  including  with women,  youth,  Indigenous  Peoples, 
local communities, and ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development and has allowed 
locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions (high confidence). {WGII SPM D.2, D.2.1} 

Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. These instruments 
could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely. Practical experience has 
informed  instrument  design  and  helped  to  improve  predictability,  environmental  effectiveness,  economic 
efficiency, and equity. (high confidence) {WGII SPM E.4; WGIII SPM E.4.2}.  

Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, consistent with national circumstances, can 
improve mitigation outcomes in sectoral applications (high confidence), and regulatory instruments that 
include flexibility mechanisms can reduce costs of cutting emissions (medium confidence). {WGII SPM 
C.5.4; WGIII SPM E.4.1}  

Where  implemented,  carbon  pricing  instruments  have  incentivized  low-cost  emissions  reduction 
measures,  but  have  been  less  effective,  on  their  own  and  at  prevailing  prices  during  the  assessment 
period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions (medium confidence). Revenue 
from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used for equity and distributional goals, for example to support 
low-income  households,  among  other  approaches  (high  confidence).  There  is  no  consistent  evidence  that 
current emission trading systems have led to significant emissions leakage (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM 
E4.2, WGIII SPM E.4.6}  

Removing  fossil  fuel  subsidies  would  reduce  emissions,  improve  public  revenue  and  macroeconomic 
performance, and yield other environmental and sustainable development benefits such as improved 
public  revenue,  macroeconomic  and  sustainability  performance;  subsidy  removal  can  have  adverse 
distributional impacts especially on the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases, can 
be mitigated by measures such as re-distributing revenue saved, and depend on national circumstances 
(high confidence). Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO2 emissions 
by 1–4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying across regions (medium confidence). {WGIII 
SPM E.4.2}  

National  policies  to  support  technology  development,  and  participation  in  international  markets  for 
emission reduction, can bring positive spillover effects for other countries (medium confidence), although 
reduced demand for fossil fuels as a result of climate policy could result in costs to exporting countries (high 
confidence).  Economy-wide  packages  can  meet  short-term  economic  goals  while  reducing  emissions  and 
shifting  development pathways  towards sustainability  (medium  confidence).  Examples are public spending 
commitments;  pricing  reforms;  and  investment  in  education  and  training,  R&D  and  infrastructure  (high 
confidence). Effective policy packages would be comprehensive in coverage, harnessed to a clear vision for 
change, balanced across objectives, aligned with specific technology and system needs, consistent in terms of 
design and tailored to national circumstances (high confidence). {WGIII SPM E4.4, WGIII SPM 4.5, WGIII

4.8  Strengthening the Response: Finance, International Cooperation and Technology 

Finance, international cooperation and technology are critical enablers for accelerated climate action. 
If climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would have to increase 
many-fold. There is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gaps but there are barriers 
to  redirect  capital  to  climate  action.  Barriers  include  institutional,  regulatory  and  market  access 
barriers,  are  reduced  and  address  the  needs  and  opportunities,  economic  vulnerability  and 
indebtedness in many developing countries. Enhancing international cooperation is possible through 
multiple  channels.  Enhancing  technology  innovation  systems  is  key  to  accelerate  the  widespread 
adoption of technologies and practices. (high confidence)  

4.8.1  Finance for Mitigation and Adaptation Actions 

Improved  availability  and  access  to  finance100  will  enable  accelerated  climate  action  (very  high 
confidence).  Addressing  needs  and  gaps  and  broadening  equitable  access  to  domestic  and  international 
finance, when combined with other supportive actions, can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and 
shifting  development  pathways  (high  confidence).  Climate  resilient  development  is  enabled  by  increased 
international cooperation including improved access to financial resources, particularly for vulnerable regions, 
sectors  and  groups,  and  inclusive  governance  and  coordinated  policies  (high  confidence).  Accelerated 
international  financial  cooperation  is  a  critical  enabler  of  low-GHG  and  just  transitions,  and  can  address 
inequities  in  access  to  finance  and  the  costs  of,  and  vulnerability  to,  the  impacts  of  climate  change  (high 
confidence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII SPM D.2, WGII

Both adaptation and mitigation finance need to increase many-fold, to address rising climate risks and 
to accelerate investments in emissions reduction (high confidence). Increased finance would address soft 
limits to adaptation and rising climate risks while also averting some related losses and damages, particularly 
in vulnerable developing countries (high confidence). Enhanced mobilisation of and access to finance, together 
with building capacity, are essential for implementation of adaptation actions and to reduce adaptation gaps 
given rising risks and costs, especially for the most vulnerable groups, regions and sectors (high confidence). 
Public finance is an important enabler of adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance (high 
confidence).  Adaptation  funding  predominately  comes  from  public  sources,  and  public  mechanisms  and 
finance  can  leverage  private  sector  finance  by  addressing  real  and  perceived  regulatory,  cost  and  market 
barriers, for instance via public-private partnerships (high confidence). Financial and technological resources 
enable effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation, especially when supported by institutions with a 
strong understanding of adaptation needs and capacity (high confidence). Average annual modelled mitigation 
investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three 
to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) 
would need to increase across all sectors and regions (medium confidence). Even if extensive global mitigation 
efforts are implemented, there will be a large need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation 
(high confidence) (Section 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 4.4, Figure 4.6) {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C2.11, WGII SPM

There is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close global investment gaps, given the size of the global 
financial system, but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action both within and outside the 
global  financial  sector  and  in  the  context  of  economic  vulnerabilities  and  indebtedness  facing  many 

100 Finance can originate from diverse sources, singly or in combination: public or private, local, national or international, bilateral or 
multilateral, and alternative sources (e.g., philanthropic, carbon offsets). It can be in the form of grants, technical assistance, loans 
(concessional and non-concessional), bonds, equity, risk insurance and financial guarantees (of various types).

developing countries (high confidence). For shifts in private finance, options include better assessment of 
climate-related risks and investment opportunities within the financial system, reducing sectoral and regional 
mismatches  between  available  capital  and  investment  needs,  improving  the  risk-return  profiles  of  climate 
investments,  and  developing  institutional  capacities  and  local  capital  markets.  Macroeconomic  barriers 
include, amongst others, indebtedness and economic vulnerability of developing regions. (high confidence). 
{WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM E.4.2, WGIII SPM E.5, WGIII SPM E.5.2, WGIII SPM E.5.3} 

Scaling up financial flows requires clear signalling from governments and the international community. 
Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals 
across all sectors and regions. These gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps 
is largest in developing countries. This includes a stronger alignment of public finance, lowering real and 
perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, and higher levels of public finance to lower the risks associated 
with low-emission investments. Up-front risks deter economically sound low carbon projects, and developing 
local capital markets are an option. Investors, financial intermediaries, central banks and financial regulators 
can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-related risks. A robust labelling of bonds and transparency is 
needed to attract savers. (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.4, WGIII

Accelerated  support  from  developed  countries  and  multilateral  institutions  is  a  critical  enabler  to  enhance 
mitigation and adaptation action and can address inequities in finance, including its costs, terms and conditions, 
and economic vulnerability to climate change. Scaled-up public grants for mitigation and adaptation funding 
for vulnerable regions, e.g., in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and have high social returns in 
terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation and adaptation in developing regions include: 
increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing 
countries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal of the Paris Agreement; increase the use of public 
guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and 
building greater trust in international cooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic 
recovery sustainable over the long term through increased flows of financing over this decade can accelerate 
climate  action,  including  in  developing  regions  facing  high  debt  costs,  debt  distress  and  macroeconomic 
uncertainty. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.5.2, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII SPM C.6.5, WGII SPM D.2, WGII

4.8.2 

International Cooperation and Coordination  

International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation goals 
and climate resilient development (high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled by increased 
international cooperation including mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing 
countries, vulnerable regions, sectors and groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent 
with ambition levels and funding needs (high confidence). While agreed processes and goals, such as those in 
the  UNFCCC,  Kyoto  Protocol  and  Paris  Agreement,  are  helping  (Section  2.2.1),  international  financial, 
technology and capacity building support to developing countries will enable greater implementation and more 
ambitious actions (medium confidence). By integrating equity and climate justice, national and international 
policies can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability, especially by mobilising 
and  enhancing  access  to  finance  for  vulnerable  regions,  sectors  and  communities  (high  confidence). 
International  cooperation  and  coordination,  including  combined  policy  packages,  may  be  particularly 
important for sustainability transitions in emissions-intensive and highly traded basic materials industries that 
are exposed to international competition (high confidence). The large majority of emission modelling studies 
assume significant international cooperation to secure financial flows and address inequality and poverty issues 
in pathways limiting global warming. There are large variations in the modelled effects of mitigation on GDP 
across regions, depending notably on economic  structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and 
level of international cooperation (high confidence). Delayed global cooperation increases policy costs across 
regions (high confidence). {WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D.3.1, WGII SPM D.5.2; WGIII SPM D.3.4, WGIII

The transboundary nature of many climate change risks (e.g., for supply chains, markets and natural 
resource flows in food, fisheries, energy and water, and potential for conflict) increases the need for 
climate-informed  transboundary  management,  cooperation,  responses  and  solutions  through  multi-
national  or  regional  governance  processes  (high  confidence).  Multilateral  governance  efforts  can  help 
reconcile  contested  interests,  world  views  and  values  about  how  to  address  climate  change.  International 
environment  and  sectoral  agreements,  and  initiatives  in  some  cases,  may  help  to  stimulate  low  GHG 
investment  and  reduce  emissions  (such  as  ozone  depletion,  transboundary  air  pollution  and  atmospheric 
emissions of mercury). Improvements to national and international governance structures would further enable 
the decarbonisation of shipping and aviation through deployment of low-emissions fuels, for example through 
stricter  efficiency  and  carbon  intensity  standards.  Transnational  partnerships  can  also  stimulate  policy 
development, low-emissions technology diffusion, emission reductions and adaptation, by linking sub-national 
and other actors, including cities, regions, non-governmental organisations and private sector entities, and by 
enhancing  interactions  between  state  and  non-state  actors,  though  uncertainties  remain  over  their  costs, 
feasibility, and effectiveness. International environmental and sectoral agreements, institutions, and initiatives 
are helping, and in some cases may help, to stimulate low GHG emissions investment and reduce emissions.

4.8.3  Technology Innovation, Adoption, Diffusion and Transfer  

Enhancing  technology  innovation  systems  can  provide  opportunities  to  lower  emissions  growth  and 
create  social  and  environmental  co-benefits.  Policy  packages  tailored  to  national  contexts  and 
technological characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology 
diffusion. Support for successful low-carbon technological innovation includes public policies such as training 
and  R&D,  complemented  by  regulatory  and  market-based  instruments  that  create  incentives  and  market 
opportunities such as appliance performance standards and building codes. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM 
B.4, WGIII SPM B.4.4, WGIII SPM E.4.3, WGIII SPM E4.4}. 

International  cooperation  on  innovation  systems  and  technology  development  and  transfer, 
accompanied  by  capacity  building,  knowledge  sharing,  and  technical  and  financial  support  can 
accelerate the  global  diffusion  of  mitigation  technologies,  practices  and  policies  and  align these  with 
other development objectives (high confidence). Choice architecture can help end-users adopt technology 
and  low-GHG-intensive  options  (high  confidence).  Adoption  of  low-emission  technologies  lags  in  most 
developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including 
limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building (medium confidence). {WGIII 
SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM E.6.2, WGIII SPM C.10.4, WGIII Chapter 16.5} 

International cooperation on innovation works best when tailored to and beneficial for local value chains, 
when partners collaborate on an equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the effort 
(medium confidence). {WGIII SPM E.4.4, WGIII SPM E.6.2}. 

Technological  innovation  can  have  trade-offs  that  include  externalities  such  as  new  and  greater 
environmental impacts and social inequalities; rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions 
or even emission increases; and overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers (high confidence). 
Appropriately  designed  policies  and  governance  have  helped  address  distributional  impacts  and  rebound 
effects (high confidence). For example, digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency 
through coordination and an economic shift to services (high confidence). However, societal digitalization can 
induce  greater  consumption  of  goods  and  energy  and  increased  electronic  waste  as  well  as  negatively 
impacting  labour  markets  and  worsening  inequalities  between  and  within  countries  (medium  confidence). 
Digitalisation  requires  appropriate  governance  and  policies  in  order  to  enhance  mitigation  potential  (high 
confidence) . Effective policy packages can help to realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound 
effects: these might include a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon 
pricing, finance and technical assistance (high confidence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM B.4.3, WGIII

Integration of Near-Term Actions Across Sectors and Systems  

The feasibility, effectiveness and benefits of mitigation and adaptation actions are increased when  
multi-sectoral solutions are undertaken that cut across systems. When such options are combined 
with broader sustainable development objectives, they can yield greater benefits for human well-
being, social equity and justice, and ecosystem and planetary health. (high confidence) 

Climate  resilient  development  strategies  that  treat  climate,  ecosystems  and  biodiversity,  and  human 
society as parts of an integrated system are the most effective (high confidence). Human and ecosystem 
vulnerability are interdependent (high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled when decision-
making processes and actions are integrated across sectors (very high confidence). Synergies with and progress 
towards the Sustainable Development Goals enhance prospects for climate resilient development. Choices and 
actions that treat humans and ecosystems as an integrated system build on diverse knowledge about climate 
risk,  equitable,  just  and  inclusive  approaches,  and  ecosystem  stewardship.  {WGII  SPM  B.2,  WGII  Figure 
SPM.5, WGII SPM D.2, WGII SPM D2.1, WGII SPM 2.2, WGII SPM D4, WGII SPM D4.1, WGII SPM 
D4.2, WGII SPM D5.2, WGII SPM Figure SPM.5}.  

Approaches that align goals and actions across sectors provide opportunities for multiple and large-
scale benefits and avoided damages in the near-term. Such measures can also achieve greater benefits 
through cascading effects across sectors (medium confidence). For example, the feasibility of using land 
for  both  agriculture  and  centralised  solar  production  can  increase  when  such  options  are  combined  (high 
confidence).  Similarly,  integrated  transport  and  energy  infrastructure  planning  and  operations  can  together 
reduce  the  environmental, social, and  economic impacts  of  decarbonising the transport  and  energy sectors 
(high  confidence).  The  implementation  of  packages  of  multiple  city-scale  mitigation  strategies  can  have 
cascading effects across sectors and reduce GHG emissions both within and outside a city’s administrative 
boundaries (very high confidence). Integrated design approaches to the construction and retrofit of buildings 
provide  increasing  examples  of  zero  energy  or  zero  carbon  buildings  in  several  regions.  To  minimise 
maladaptation,  multi-sectoral,  multi-actor  and  inclusive  planning  with  flexible  pathways  encourages  low-
regret and timely actions that keep options open, ensure benefits in multiple sectors and systems and suggest 
the available solution space for adapting to long-term climate change (very high confidence). Trade-offs in 
terms  of  employment,  water  use,  land-use  competition  and  biodiversity,  as  well  as  access  to,  and  the 
affordability of, energy, food, and water can be avoided by well-implemented land-based mitigation options, 
especially  those  that  do  not  threaten  existing  sustainable  land  uses  and  land  rights,  with  frameworks  for 
integrated  policy  implementation  (high  confidence){WGII  SPM  C.2,  WGII  SPM  C.2.1–2.13,  WGII  SPM

SPM D.1.5, WGIII SPM E.1.2} 

Mitigation  and  adaptation  when  implemented  together,  and  combined  with  broader  sustainable 
development objectives, would yield multiple benefits for human well-being as well as ecosystem and 
planetary health (high confidence). The range of such positive interactions is significant in the landscape of 
near-term climate policies across regions, sectors and systems. For example, AFOLU mitigation actions in 
land-use  change  and  forestry,  when  sustainably  implemented,  can  provide  large-scale  GHG  emission 
reductions  and  removals  that  simultaneously  benefit  biodiversity,  food  security,  wood  supply  and  other 
ecosystem  services  but  cannot  fully compensate  for  delayed  mitigation  action in  other sectors.  Adaptation 
measures in land, ocean and ecosystems similarly can have widespread benefits for food security, nutrition, 
health and well-being, ecosystems and biodiversity. Equally, urban systems are critical, interconnected sites 
for climate resilient development; urban policies that implement multiple interventions can yield adaptation or 
mitigation  gains  with  equity  and  human  well-being.  Integrated  policy  packages can  improve  the  ability  to 
integrate  considerations  of  equity,  gender  equality  and  justice.  Coordinated  cross-sectoral  policies  and 
planning can maximise synergies and avoid or reduce trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation. Effective 
action  in  all  of  the  above  areas  will  require  near-term  political  commitment  and  follow-through,  social
