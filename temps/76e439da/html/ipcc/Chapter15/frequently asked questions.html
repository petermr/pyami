    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21105">The Paris Agreement has widened the scope of all financial flows from climate finance only to the full alignment of finance flows with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. While climate finance relates historically to the financial support of developed countries to developing countries, the Paris Agreement and its Article 2.1(c) has developed on a new narrative on that goes much beyond traditional flows  and  relates  to  all  sectors  and  actors.  Finance  flows  are  consistent  when  the  effects  are  either neutral  with  or  without  positive  climate  co-benefits  to  climate  objectives;  or  explicitly  targeted  on climate  benefits  in  adaptation  and/or  mitigation  result  areas.  Climate-related  financial  risk  is  still massively underestimated by financial institutions, financial decision-makers more generally and also </span>

Dynamics vary across sectors and regions with the financial sector being an enabler of transitions in  only  some  selected  (sub-)sectors  and  regions.  Consistent,  credible,  timely  and  forward-looking political leadership remains central to strengthen the financial sector as enabler. </span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21127">There is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term 'climate finance' is applied to the financial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales,  including  international  financial  flows  to  developing  countries  to  assist  them  in  addressing climate change. Total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect aims to reduce net  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and/or  to  enhance  resilience  to  the  impacts  of  current  and projected climate change. This includes private and public funds, domestic and international flows and </span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21138">Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. Annual global climate finance flows are on an upward trend since the fifth Assessment Report, according to CPI reaching more than 630 billion USD in 2019/2020, however, growth has likely slowed down and flows  remain  significantly  below  needs.  This  is  driven  by  barriers  within  and  outside  the  financial sector. More than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities despite the strong economic rationale of adaptation action.  Adjusting for higher estimates on current flows for energy efficiency based on IEA data, the dominance of mitigation becomes even stronger. Persistently high levels of both </span>

  <div style="top: 91166px;" id="id21248">
    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21249">A financing gap is defined as the difference between current flows and average needs to meet the long term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  Gaps  are  driven  by  various  barriers  inside  (short-termism, information gaps, home bias, limited visibility of future pipelines) and outside (e.g. missing pricing of externalities, missing regulatory frameworks) of the financial sector. Current mitigation financing flows come  in  significantly  below  average  needs  across  all  regions  and  sectors  despite  the  availability  of sufficient capital on a global basis. Globally, yearly climate finance flows have to increase by factor between 3 to 6 to meet average annual needs until 2030. </span>

Also,  limited  institutional  capacity represents  a  key  barrier  for  many  developing  countries  burdening  risk  perceptions  and  access  to appropriately priced financing as well as limiting their ability to actively manage the transformation. Existing fundamental inequities in access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries exposure to physical impacts of climate change overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition. </span>
