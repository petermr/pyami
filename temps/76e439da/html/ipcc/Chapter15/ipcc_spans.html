Fundamental  inequities  in access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries exposure to physical impacts of  climate  change  overall  result  in  a  worsening  outlook  for  a  global  just  transition  (high confidence).  Decarbonising  the  economy  requires  global  action  to  address  fundamental  economic inequities and   overcome the climate investment trap that exists for many developing countries. For these countries the costs and risks of financing often represent a significant challenge for stakeholders at  all  levels.  This  challenge  is  exacerbated  by  these  countries’  general  economic  vulnerability  and indebtedness. The rising public fiscal costs of mitigation, and of adapting to climate shocks, is affecting many countries and worsening public indebtedness and country credit ratings at a time when there were already significant stresses on public finances. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these stresses worse and  tightened  public  finances  still  further.  Other  major  challenges  for  commercial  climate  finance include: the mismatch between capital and investment needs, home bias1 considerations, differences in risk  perceptions for  regions,  as  well  as  limited institutional capacity to  ensure  safeguards  represent. {15.2, 15.6.3} Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk. This  increased  awareness  can  support  climate  policy  development  and  implementation  (high confidence).  Climate-related  financial  risks  arise  from  physical  impacts  of  climate  change  (already relevant in the short term), and from a disorderly transition to a low carbon economy. Awareness of these  risks  is  increasing  leading  also  to  concerns  about  financial  stability.  Financial  regulators  and institutions have responded with multiple regulatory and voluntary initiatives by to assess and address these risks. Yet despite these initiatives, climate-related financial risks remain greatly underestimated by  financial  institutions  and  markets  limiting  the  capital  reallocation  needed  for  the  low-carbon transition. Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity – which act as a barrier to the transformation – are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community. Stronger steering by regulators  and  policy makers  has  the  potential  to  close  this  gap.  Despite  the  increasing  attention  of investors to climate change, there is limited evidence that this attention has directly impacted emission reductions. This leaves high uncertainty, both near-term (2021-30) and longer-term (2021-50), on the feasibility of an alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement (high confidence). {15.2, 15.6} Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. There is a climate financing gap which reflects a persistent misallocation of global capital (high confidence). Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil-fuel related financing continue to be  of  major  concern  despite  promising  recent  commitments.  This  reflects  policy  misalignment,  the current perceived risk-return profile of fossil fuel-related investments, and political economy constraints (high confidence). {15.3} Estimates of climate finance flows  – which refers to local, national, or transnational financing from public,  private,  multilateral,  bilateral  and  alternative  sources,  to  support  mitigation  and  adaptation actions addressing climate change – exhibit highly divergent patterns across regions and sectors and a slowing growth. {15.3} When the perceived risks are too high the misallocation of abundant savings persists. Investors refrain from investing in infrastructure and industry in search of safer financial assets, even earning low or negative real returns. {15.2, 15.3} FOOTNOTE 1 Most of climate finance stays within national borders, especially private climate flows (over 90%). Reasons are national policy support, differences in regulatory standards, exchange rate, political and governance risks, to information market failures.

This is despite the significant economic effects of climate change’s expected physical impacts, and  the  increasing  awareness  of  these  effects  on  financial  stability.  To  meet  the  needs  for  rapid deployment of mitigation options, global mitigation investments are expected to need to increase by the factor  of  3  to  6  (high  confidence).  The  gaps  represent  a  major  challenge  for  developing  countries, especially Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where flows have to increase by factor 4 to 8, for specific sectors like AFOLU, and for specific groups with limited access to-, and high costs of-, climate finance (high confidence). {15.4, 15.5} The  actual  size  of  sectoral  and  regional  climate  financing  gaps  is  only  one  component  driving  the magnitude of the challenge, with financial and economic viability, access to capital markets, appropriate regulatory  frameworks  and  institutional  capacity  to  attract  and  facilitate  investments  and  ensure safeguards being decisive to scale-up financing. Financing needs for the creation and strengthening of regulatory  environment  and  institutional  capacity,  upstream  financing  needs  as  well  as  R&amp;D  and venture capital for development of new technologies and business models are often overlooked despite their critical role to facilitate the deployment of scaled-up climate finance (high confidence). {15.4.1, 15.5.2} The relatively slow implementation of commitments by countries and stakeholders in the financial system to scale up climate finance reflects neither the urgent need for ambitious climate action, nor  the  economic  rationale  for  ambitious  climate  action.  (high  confidence).  Delayed  climate investments and financing – and limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreement – will  result  in  significant  carbon  lock-ins,  stranded  assets,  and  other  additional  costs.  This  will particularly  impact  urban  infrastructure  and  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  (high  confidence).  A common understanding of debt sustainability and debt transparency, including negative implications of deferred  climate  investments  on  future  GDP,  and  how  stranded  assets  and  resources  may  be compensated, has not yet been developed (medium confidence). {15.6} The greater the urgency of action to remain on a 1.5°C pathway the greater need for parallel investment decisions in upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. Greater urgency also reduces the lead times to build trust in regulatory frameworks. Consequently, many investment decisions will need to be made based on the long-term global goals. This highlights the importance of trust in political leadership which, in turn, affects risk perception and ultimately financing costs (high confidence). {15.6.1, 15.6.2} There  is  a  mismatch  between  capital  availability  in  the  developed  world  and  the  future  emissions expected in developing countries. This emphasizes the need to recognize the explicit and positive social value of global cross-border mitigation financing. A significant push for international climate finance access for vulnerable and poor countries is particularly important given these countries’ high costs of financing, debt stress and the impacts of ongoing climate change (high confidence). {15.2, 15.3.2.3, 15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.7} Ambitious global climate policy coordination and stepped-up (public) climate financing over the next decade (2021–2030) can help address macroeconomic uncertainty and alleviate developing countries’ debt burden post-COVID-19. It can also help redirect capital markets and overcome challenges relating to the need for parallel investments in mitigation and the up-front risks that deter economically sound low carbon projects. (high confidence) Providing strong climate policy signals  helps  guide  investment  decisions.  Credible  signalling  by  governments  and  the  international community  can  reduce  uncertainty  for  financial  decision-makers  and  help  reduce  transition  risk.  In addition to indirect and direct subsidies, the public sector’s role in addressing market failures, barriers, provision of information, and risk sharing (equity, various forms of public guarantees) can encourage the efficient mobilisation of private sector finance (high confidence). {15.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.2} The mutual benefits of coordinated support for climate mitigation and adaptation in the next decade for both developed and developing regions could potentially be very high in the post-Covid era. Climate compatible stimulus packages could significantly reduce the macro-financial uncertainty generated by Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-4  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII the pandemic and increase the sustainability of the world economic recovery. {15.2, 15.3.2.3, 15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.7} Political leadership and intervention remains central to addressing uncertainty as a fundamental barrier for a redirection of financial flows. Existing policy misalignments – for example in fossil fuel subsidies – undermine the credibility of public commitments, reduce perceived transition risks and limit financial sector action (high confidence). {15.2, 15.3.3, 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.3} Innovative financing approaches could help reduce the systemic underpricing of climate risk in markets and foster demand for Paris-aligned investment opportunities. Approaches include de-risking investments, robust ‘green’ labelling and disclosure schemes, in addition to a regulatory focus on transparency and reforming international monetary system financial sector regulations (medium confidence). Green bond markets and markets for sustainable finance products have grown significantly since AR5 and the landscape continues to evolve. Underpinning this evolution is investors’ preference  for  scalable  and  identifiable  low-carbon  investment  opportunities.  These  relatively  new labelled  financial  products  will  help  by  allowing  a  smooth  integration  into  existing  asset  allocation models. (high confidence) Green bond markets and markets for sustainable finance products have also increased significantly since AR5, but challenges nevertheless remain, in particular there are concerns about  ‘greenwashing’  and  the  limited  application  of  these  markets  to  developing  countries.  New business models (e.g. pay-as-you-go) can facilitate the aggregation of small-scale financing needs and provide  scalable  investment  opportunities  with  more  attractive  risk-return  profiles.  Support  and guidance  for  enhancing  transparency  can  promote  capital  markets’  climate  financing  by  providing quality information to price climate risks and opportunities. Examples include sustainable development goals (SDG) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, scenario analysis and climate risk  assessments,  including  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD).  The outcome of these market-correcting approaches on capital flows cannot be taken for granted, however, without  appropriate  fiscal,  monetary  and  financial  policies.  Mitigation  policies  will  be  required  to enhance  the  risk-weighted  return  of  low  emission  and  climate  resilient  options,  and  -  supported  by progress  in  transparent  and  scientifically  based  projects’  assessment  methods  -  to  accelerate  the emergence and support for financial products based on real projects, such as green bonds, and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Greater public-private cooperation can also encourage the private sector to increase  and  broaden  investments,  within  a  context  of  safeguards  and  standards,  and  this  can  be integrated into national climate change policies and plans. {15.1, 15.2.4, 15.3.1, 15.3.2, 15.3.3, 15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.6, 15.6.7, 15.6.8}.  The following policy options can have important long-term catalytic benefits (high confidence). (i) Stepped-up both the quantum and composition of financial, technical support and partnership in low-income and vulnerable countries alongside low-carbon energy access in low-income countries, such as Sub-Saharan  Africa,  which  currently  receives  less  than  5%  of  global  climate  financing  flows;  (ii) continued  strong  role  of  international  and  national  financial  institutions,  including  multilateral, especially  location-based  regional,  and  national  development  banks;  (iii)  de-risking  cross-border investments in low-carbon infrastructure, development of local green bond markets, and the alignment of climate and non-climate policies, including direct and in-direct supports on fossil fuels, consistent with the climate goals; (iv) lowering financing costs including transaction costs and addressing risks through funds and risk-sharing mechanisms for under-served groups; (v) accelerated finance for nature-based  solutions,  including  mitigation  in  the  forest  sector  (REDD+),  and  climate-responsive  social protection; (vi)  improved  financing  instruments  for loss  and  damage  events, including  risk-pooling-transfer-sharing for climate risk insurance; (vii)  phasing-in carbon pricing and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies  in  a  way  that  addresses  equity  and  access;  and    (viii)  gender-responsive  and  women empowered  programs  {15.2.3,  15.2.4,  15.3.1,  15.3.2.2,  15.3.3,  15.4.1,  15.4.2,  15.4.3,  15.5.2,  15.6, 15.6.2, 15.6.4, 15.6.5, 15.6.6, 15.6.7, 15.6.8.2}. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-5  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 15.1 Introduction 15.1.1  Climate finance - key concepts and elements of scope Finance  for  climate  action  (or  climate  finance),  environmental  finance  (which  also  covers  other environmental priorities such as water, air pollution and biodiversity), and sustainable finance (which encompasses  issues  relating  to  socio-economic  impacts,  poverty  alleviation  and  empowerment)  are interrelated  rather  than  mutually  exclusive  concepts  (UNEP  Inquiry  2016a;  ICMA  2020a).  Their combination is needed to align mitigation investments with multiple SDGs, at a minimum, minimize the conflicts between climate targets and SDGs not being targeted. From a climate policy perspective, climate finance refers to finance “whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or enhance resilience  to  the  impacts  of  climate  variability  and  projected  climate  change”  (UNFCCC  2018a). However,  as  pinpointed  in  the  AR5,  significant  room  for  interpretation  and  context-specific considerations remain. Further, such definition needs to be put in perspective with the expectations of investors and financiers (see Box 15.2).   Specifying the scope of climate finance requires defining two terms: what qualifies as “finance” and as “climate”  respectively.  In  terms  of  what  type  of  finance  to  consider,  options  include  considering investments or total costs (see Box 15.1), stocks or flows, gross or net (the latter taking into account reflows and/or depreciation), and domestic or cross-border, public or private (see Box 15.2). In terms of what may be considered as “climate”, a key difference relates to measuring climate-specific finance (only accounts for the portion finance resulting in climate benefits) or climate-related finance (captures total project costs and aims to measure the mainstreaming of climate considerations). One should even consider the investments decided for reasons unrelated with climate objectives but contribute to these objectives (hydroelectricity, rail transportation). ‘START BOX 15.1 HERE’ Box 15.1 Core Terms This box defines some core terms used in this chapter as well as in other chapters addressing finance issues: cost, investment, financing, public and private. The chapter makes broad use of the  finance  to refer to all types of transactions involving monetary amounts. It avoids the use of the terms funds and funding to the extent possible, which should otherwise be understood as synonyms for money and money provided. Cost,  investment  and  financing:  different  but  intertwined  concepts.  Cost  encompass  capital expenditures (CAPEX or upfront investment value leveraged over the lifetime of a project) operating and maintenance expenditures (OPEX), as well as financing costs. Note that some projects e.g. related to technical assistance may only involve OPEX (e.g. staff costs) but no CAPEX , or may not incur direct financing costs (e.g. if fully financed via own funds and grants). Investment,  in  an  economic  sense,  is  the  purchase  of  (or  CAPEX  for)  a  physical  asset  (notably infrastructure or equipment) or intangible asset (e.g. patents, IT solutions) not consumed immediately but used over time. For financial investors, physical and intangible assets take the form of financial assets such as bonds or stocks which are expecting to provide income or be sold at a higher price later. In practice, investment decisions are motivated by a calculation of risk-weighted expected returns that takes into account all expected costs, as well as the different types of risks, discussed in Section 15.6.1, that may impact the returns of the investment and even turn them into losses.  Incremental cost (or investment) accounts for the difference between the cost (or investment value) for a climate projects compared to the cost (or investment value) of a counterfactual reference project (or investment).  In  cases  where  climate  projects  and  investments  are  more  cost  effective  than  the counterfactual, the incremental cost will be negative.  Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-6  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII Financing refers to the process of securing the money needed to cover an investment or project cost. Financing can rely on debt (e.g. through bond issuance or loan subscription), equity issuances (listed or unlisted shares), own funds (typically savings or auto-financing through retained earnings), as well as on grants and subsidies Public and private: statistical standard and grey zones. International statistics classify economic actors  as  pertaining  to  the  public  or  private  sectors.  Households  always  qualify  as  private  and governmental  bodies  and  agencies  as  public.  Criteria  are  needed  for  other  types  of  actors  such  as enterprises  and  financial  institutions.  Most  statistics  rely  on  the  majority  ownership  and  control principle. This is the case for the Balance of Payment, which records transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world (IMF 2009). Such a strict boundary between public and private sectors may not always be suitable for mapping and assessing investment and financing activities. On the one hand, some publicly owned entities may have a mandate to operate on a fully- or semi-commercial basis, e.g. state-owned enterprises, commercial banks, and pension funds, as well as sovereign wealth funds. On the other hand, some privately owned or -controlled entities can pursue non-for profit objectives, e.g. philanthropies and charities. The present chapter considers these nuances to the extent made possible by available data and information. ‘END BOX 15.1 HERE In many cases, the scope of what may be considered as “climate finance” will also depend on the context of implementation such as priorities and activities listed in NDCs (UNFCCC 2019a) as well as national development plans more broadly targeting the achievement of SDGs. Hence, rather than opposing the different  options  listed  above,  the  choice  of  one  or  the  other  depends  on  the  desired  scope  of measurement, which in turn depends on the policy objective being pursued. The increasingly diverse initiatives  and  body  of  grey  literature  address  a  range  of  different  information  needs.  They  provide analyses  at  the  levels  of  domestic  finance  flows  (e.g.  (UNDP  2015;  Hainaut  and  Cochran  2018)), international flows (e.g. (OECD 2016; AfDB et al. 2018)), global flows (UNFCCC 2018a; Buchner et al. 2019)), the financial system (e.g. (UNEP Inquiry 2016a) or specific financial instruments such as bonds (e.g. (CBI 2018)). Common frameworks, reporting transparency are, however, necessary in order to identify overlaps, commonalities and differences between these different measurements in terms of scope  and  underlying  definitions.  In  that  regard,  the  developments  of  national  and  international taxonomies, definitions and standards can help, as further discussed in Section 15.6. and Chapter 17 in WGII (TSU please confirm). ‘START BOX 15.2 HERE Box 15.2 International climate finance architecture International  climate  finance  can  flow  through  different  bilateral,  multilateral,  and  other  channels, involving a range of different types of institutions both public (official) and private (commercial) with different mandates and focuses. In practice, the architecture of international public climate finance is rapidly evolving, with the creation by traditional donors of new public sources and channels of over the years  (Watson  and  Schalatek  2019),  as  well  as  emergence  of  new  providers  of  development  co-operation,  both  bilateral  (see  (Benn  and  Luijkx  2017))  and  multilateral  (e.g.  Asian  Infrastructure Investment Bank), as well as of non-governmental actors such as philanthropies (OECD 2018a). The operationalisation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which channels the majority of its funds via accredited entities, has notably attracted particular attention since AR5. Section 14.3.2 of Chapter 14 provides a further assessment of progress and challenges of financial mechanisms under the UNFCCC, such as the GCF, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Adaptation Fund (AF). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-7  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 The multiplication of sources and channels of international climate finance can help address growing climate-related needs, and partly results from increased decentralisation as well financial innovation, which in turn can increase the effectiveness of finance provided. There is, however, also evidence that increased complexity implies transaction costs (Brunner and Enting 2014), in part due to bureaucracy and  intra-governmental  factors  (Peterson  and  Skovgaard  2019),  which  constitutes  a  barrier  to  low carbon projects and are often not accounted for in assessments of international climate finance. On the ground, activities by international providers operating in the same countries may overlap, with sub-optimal  coordination  and  hence  duplication  of  efforts,  both  on  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  sides (Ahluwalia et al. 2016; Gallagher et al. 2018; Humphrey and Michaelowa 2019), as well as risks of fragmentation  of  efforts  (Watson  and  Schalatek  2020)  which  slows  down  coordination  with international providers, national development banks and other domestic institutions. ‘END BOX 15.2 HERE’ Beyond the need to scale up levels of climate finance, the Paris Agreement provides a broad policy environment  and  momentum  for  a  more  systemic  and  transformational  change  in  investment  and financing strategies and patterns. Article 2.1c, which calls for “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”, positions finance as one of the Agreement’s three overarching goals (UNFCCC 2015). This formulation is a recognition that the mitigation and resilience goals cannot be achieved without finance, both in the real economy and in the financial system, being made consistent with these goals (Zamarioli et al. 2021). It has in turn contributed to the development of the concept of alignment (with the Paris Agreement) used in the financial sector (banks, institutional investors), businesses, and public institutions (development banks, public budgets). As a result, since AR5, in addition to measuring and analysing climate finance, an increasing focus has been placed on assessing the consistency or alignment, as well as respectively the inconsistency or misalignment, of finance with climate policy objectives, as for instance illustrated by the multilateral development banks joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreements (MDBs 2018).  Assessing climate consistency or alignment implies looking at all investment and financing activities, whether they target, contribute to, undermine or have no particular impact on climate objectives. This all-encompassing scope notably includes remaining investments and financing for high-GHG emission activities that may be incompatible with remaining carbon budgets, but also activities that may play a transition  role  in climate mitigation pathways and  scenarios  (see  Section  15.3.2.3).  As a  result,  any meaningful assessments of progress requires implies the use of different shades to assess activities based on their negative, neutral (“do no harm”) or positive contributions, e.g. (CICERO 2015; Cochran and Pauthier  2019;  Natixis  2019).  Doing  so  in  practice  requires  the  development  of  robust  definitions, assessment methods and metrics, an area of work and research that remained under development at the time of writing. A range of financial sector coalitions, civil society organisations as well as commercial services providers to the financial industry have developed frameworks, approaches and metrics, mainly focusing on investment portfolios  (Raynaud et al. 2020; IIGCC 2021; TCFD Portfolio Alignment Team 2021; U.N.-Convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance 2021),and, to a lesser extent for real economy investments (Micale et al. 2020; Jachnik and Dobrinevski 2021).  Key findings from AR5 and other IPCC publications For the first time the IPCC in AR5 (Clarke et al. 2014) elaborated on the role of finance in a dedicated chapter.  In  the  following  year,  the  Paris  Agreement  (PA)  (UNFCCC  2015)  recognised  the transformative role of finance, as a means to achieving climate outcomes, and the need to align financial flows with the long-term global goals even as implementation issues were left unresolved  (Bodle and Noens 2018). AR5 noted the absence of a clear definition and measurement of climate finance flows, a difficulty that continues (see Sections 15.2 and 15.3)   (Weikmans and Roberts 2019). The approach taken  in  AR5  was  to  report  ranges  of  available  information  on  climate  finance  flows  from  diverse Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-8  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 sources, using a broad definition of climate finance, as in the Biennial Assessments in 2014 and again in 2018 (UNFCCC 2014a, 2018a) of the Standing Committee under the United Nations Framework Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC):  Climate  finance  is  taken  to  refer  to  local,  national  or transnational financing – drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing – that seeks to support  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  that  address  climate  change  (UNFCCC  2014b).  For  this chapter, while the focus is primarily on mitigation, adaptation, resilience and loss and damage financing needs cannot be entirely separated because of structural relationships, synergies, trade-offs and policy coherence requirements between these sub-categories of climate finance (Box 15.1).  ‘START BOX 15.3 HERE’ Box 15.3 Mitigation, adaptation and other related climate finance merit joint examination Mitigation finance deals with investments that aim to reduce global carbon emissions, while adaptation finance deals with the consequences of climate change (Lindenberg and Pauw 2013). Mitigation affects the scale of adaptation needs and adaptation may have strong synergies and co-benefits as well as trade-offs with mitigation (Grafakos et al. 2019). If mitigation investments are inadequate to reducing global warming  (as  in  last  decade)  with  asymmetric  adverse  impacts  in  lower  latitudes  and  low-lying geographies,  the  scale  of  adaptation  investments  has  to  rise  and  the  benefits  of  stronger  adaptation responses may be high (Markandya and González-Eguino 2019). If adaptation investments build greater resilience,  they  might  even  moderate  mitigation  financing  costs.  Similar  policy  coherence considerations apply to disaster risk reducing financing, the scale of which depends on success with both adaptation and mitigation (Mysiak et al. 2018). The same financial actors, especially governments and the private sector, decide at any given time on their relative allocations of available financing for mitigation, adaptation and disaster-risk from a constrained common pool of resources. The trade-offs and substitutability between closely-linked alternative uses of funds, therefore, make it essential for a simultaneous assessment of needs – as in parts of this chapter. Climate finance versus the financing of other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) faces a similar issue. A key agreement was that climate financing should be ‘new and additional’ and not at the cost of SDGs. Resources prioritising climate at the cost of non-climate development finance increases the vulnerability of a population for any given level of climate shocks, and additionality of climate financing is thus essential  (Brown et al. 2010). Policy coherence is also the reason why mitigation finance cannot be separated from consideration of spending and subsidies on fossil fuels. Climate change may additionally cause the breaching of physical and social adaptation limits, resulting in climate-related residual risks (i.e. potential impacts after all feasible mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction measures, have been implemented) (Mechler et al. 2020). Because these residual losses and damages from climate-related risks are related to overall mitigation and adaptation efforts, the magnitude of potential impacts are related to the overall quantum of  mitigation,  adaptation,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  finance  available  (Frame  et  al.  2020).  All categories of climate finance thus need to be considered together in discussions around climate finance. ‘END BOX 15.3 HERE’ The AR5 concluded that published assessments of financial flows whose expected effect was to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change aggregated 343-385 billion USD yr-1 globally between 2010 and 2012 (medium confidence). Most (95% of total) went towards mitigation, which nevertheless underfinanced and adaptation even more so. Measurement of progress towards the commitment by developed countries to provide 100 billion USD yr-1 by 2020 to developing countries, for both mitigation and adaptation (Bhattacharya et al. 2020) – a narrower goal than overall levels of climate finance – continued to be a challenge, given the lack of clear definition of such finance, although there remain divergent perspectives (see Section 15.2.4). As against these flows, annual need for global aggregate mitigation finance between 2020 and 2030 was cited briefly in the AR5 to be about 635 billion USD (mean annual), both public and private, implying that the reported Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-9  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII ‘gap’ in mitigation financing of estimated flows during 2010 to 2012 was slightly under one-half of that required (IPCC 2014). More recent published data from the Biennial Assessments (UNFCCC 2018a) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (IPCC 2018) have revised upwards the needs of financing between 2020 and 2030 to 2035 to contain global temperature rise to below 2°C and 1.5°C respectively by 2100: 1.7 trillion USD yr-1 (mean) in the Biennial Assessment 2018 for the former, and for the latter, 2.4 trillion USD yr-1 (mean) for the energy sector alone (and three-times higher if transport and other sectors were to be included). The resulting estimated gaps in annual mitigation financing during 2014 to 2017, using reporting of climate financing from published sources was about 67% for 2015, and 76% for the energy sector alone in 2017 (medium confidence), and greater if other sectors were to be included. While the annual reported flows of climate financing showed some moderate progress (see Section 15.3), from earlier 364 billion USD (mean 2010/2011) to about 600 billion USD (mean 2017/2020), with a slowing in the most recent period 2014 to 2017, the gap in financing was reported to have widened considerably (see Section 15.4 and 15.5). In the context of policy coherence, it is also important to note that reported annual investments going into the fossil-fuel sectors, oil and gas upstream and coal mining, during the same period were about the same size as global climate finance, although the absence of  alternative financing and access to low carbon energy is a complicating factor. Adaptation financing needs, meanwhile, were rising rapidly. The Adaption Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2021)    reported  that  the  current  efforts  are  insufficient  to  narrow  the  adaptation  finance  gap,  and additional adaptation finance is necessary, particularly in developing countries. The gap is expected to be aggravated by COVID-19 (high confidence). It reaffirmed earlier assessments that by 2030 (2050)  the estimated costs of adaptation ranges between 140-300 billion (280-500 billion). Against this, the reported actual global public finance flows for adaptation in  2019/2020 were estimated at 46 billion (Naran et al. 2021). The costs of climate disasters meanwhile continued to rise, affecting low-income developing  countries  the most.  Climate natural  disasters  –  not all  necessarily attributable  to  climate change – caused some 300 billion USD yr-1 economic losses and well-being losses of about 520 billion USD yr-1 (Hallegatte et al. 2017).  15.2 Background considerations The institutions under climate finance in this chapter refer to the set of financial actors, instruments and markets  that  are  recognised  to  play  a  key  role  in  financing  decisions  on  climate  mitigation  and adaptation.  For  a  definition  of  climate  financial  stock  and  flows  see  further  Section  15.3  and  the glossary. The issue of climate finance is closely related to the conversation on international cooperation and  the  question  of  how  cross-border  investments  can  support  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  in developing countries. However, the issue is also related to more general questions of how financial institutions, both public and private, can assess climate risks and opportunities from all investments, and what roles states, policy makers, regulators and markets can play in making them more sustainable. In particular, the question of the respective roles of the public and private financial actors has become important in deliberations on climate finance in recent years. The broader macroeconomic context is an important starting point. Four major events and macro trends mark the developments in climate finance in the previous five years and likely developments in the near-term. •  First,  the  2015  Paris  Agreement,  with  the  engagement  of  the  financial  sector  institutions  in  the climate agenda has been followed by a series of related developments in financial regulation in relation to climate change and in particular to the disclosure of climate related financial risk (high confidence) (see Section 15.2.1).  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-10  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII •  Second, the last five years have been characterised by a series of interconnected “headwinds” (see Section 15.2.2), including rising private and public debt and policy uncertainty which work against the objective of filling the climate investment gap (high confidence).  •  Third,  the  2020  COVID-19  pandemic  crisis  has  put  enormous  additional  strain  on  the  global economy, debt and the availability of finance, which will be longer-lasting (see Section 15.2.3). At the  same  time,  while  it  is  still  too  early  to  draw  positive  conclusions,  this  crisis  highlights opportunities  in  terms  of  political  and  policy  feasibility  and  behavioural  change  in  respect  of realigning climate finance (medium confidence). •  Fourth, the sharp rise in global inequality and the effects of the pandemic have brought into renewed sharp focus the need for a Just Transition (see Section 15.2.4) and a realignment of climate finance and policies that would be beneficial for a new social compact towards a more sustainable world that addresses energy equity and environmental justice (high confidence). 15.2.1 Paris Agreement and the engagement of the financial sector in the climate agenda This is the first IPCC AR chapter on investment and finance since the 2015 Paris Agreement, which represented  a landmark event for  climate finance  because for  the first  time the key  role  of  aligning financial flows  to  climate  goals  was spelled  out.  Since  then, the financial  sector  has  recognised  the opportunity and has stepped up to centre-stage in the global policy conversation on climate change. While before the Paris Agreement, only few financial professionals and regulators were acquainted with climate  change,  today  climate  change  is  acknowledged  as  a  strategic  priority  in  most  financial institutions. This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. However, this does not mean that finance necessarily plays an adequate enabling role for climate investments. On the contrary, the literature shows that without appropriate conditions, finance can represent a barrier to fill the climate investment gap (Hafner et al. 2020). Indeed, despite the enormous acceleration in policy initiatives (e.g. (NGFS 2020)) and coalitions of the willing in the private sectors, the effect in terms of closing the investment gap identified already in AR5 has been limited (see Section 15.5.2). Financial investors have started to account for  climate risk in some contexts but they do so only to a limited extent (Monasterolo and de Angelis 2020; Alessi et al. 2021; Bolton and Kacperczyk 2021) and the reasons for these remain unclear. Two aspects are relevant here. The first is the endogenous nature of climate financial risk and opportunities (with the term “risk” meaning here the potential for adverse financial impact whether, or not, the distribution of losses is known). Academics and practitioners in finance are aware that financial risk can in certain contexts be endogenous, i.e., the materialization of losses is affected by the action of financial players themselves. However, the standard treatment of risk both  in  financial  valuation  models  and  in  asset  pricing  assumes  that  risk  is  exogenous.  In  contrast, endogeneity is a key feature of climate risk because today’s perception of climate risk affects climate investment, which in turn affect directly the future risk.  This endogeneity leads to the fact that multiple and  rather  different  mitigation  scenarios  are  possible  (see  Chapter  3).  Moreover,  the  likelihood  of occurrence of each alternative scenario is very hard to estimate. Further, the assessment of climate-related financial risk requires to combine information related to mitigation scenarios as well as climate impact scenarios, leaving open an important knowledge gap for the next years (see Section 15.6.1).  The second aspect is that the multiplicity of equilibria results in a coordination problem whereby the majority of investors wait to move and reallocate their investments until they can follow a clear signal. Despite the initial momentum of the Paris Agreement, for many investors, both public and private, the policy signal seems not strong enough to induce them to align their investment portfolios to climate goals.

Credibility  could  require  a  policy  commitment  device  (Brunner  et  al.  2012).  The commitment would also need to be large enough (analogous to the “whatever it takes” statement by the European Central Bank during the 2011-12 European sovereign crisis (Kalinowski and Chenet 2020)). In principle, public investments in low carbon infrastructures (or private-public partnerships) as well as regulation  could  provide  credible  signals  if  their  magnitude  and  time  horizon  are  appropriate  (past experiences with FiTs models across countries provide useful lessons). 15.2.2   Macroeconomic context Entering 2020, the world already faced large macroeconomic headwinds to meeting the climate finance gap  in  the  near-term  –  barring  some  globally  coordinated  action.  While  an  understanding  of  the disaggregated country-by-country, sector-by-sector, project-by-project, and instrument-by-instrument approach  to  raising  climate  finances  analysed  in  the  later  parts  of  this  Chapter  remains  important, macroeconomic drivers of finance remain crucial in the near-term. Near-term finance financial flows in aggregate often show strong empirically observed cycles over time, especially in terms of macroeconomic and financial cycles. By near-term, we mean here the likely cycle over the next five to ten years (2020–2025 and 2020–2030), as influenced by global macroeconomic real business cycles (output, investment and consumption), with periodic asymmetric downside impacts and crises (Gertler and Kiyotaki 2010; Borio 2014; Jordà et al. 2017; Borio et al. 2018). Financial cycles typically have strong co-movements (asset prices, credit growth, interest rates, leverage, risk factors, market fear, macro-prudential and central bank policies) (Coeurdacier and Rey 2013), They have large consequences for all types of financial flows such as equity, bond and banking credit markets, which in turn are likely to impact climate finance flows to all sub-sectors and geographies (with greater expected volatility  in  more  risky  and  more  leveraged  regions).  This  is  in  contrast  to  longer-term  trend considerations  (2020–2050)  that  typically  focus  the  attention  on  drivers  of  disaggregated  flows  of climate finance and policies. The upward trends of the cycles tend to favour speculative bubbles like real estates at the expenses of investment in production and infrastructures whereas the  asymmetric downsides raise uncertainty and risks for longer-term investments on newer climate technologies, and favour a flight to near-term safety (e.g., lowest risk non-climate short-term treasury investments, highest creditworthy  countries,  and  away  from  cross-border  investments  (see  Section  15.5)    –  making  the challenge of longer-term low-carbon transition more difficult. In this respect, the impact of financial regulation is unclear. On the one hand, it could be argued that the tighter bank regulations under Basel III, combined with an economic environment with higher uncertainty and flatter yield curve, can push banks to retrench from climate finance projects (Blended Finance Taskforce, 2018a), since banks tend to limit loan maturity to 5 or 8 years, while infrastructure projects typically require the amortisation of debt over 15-20 years (Arezki et al. 2016). On the other hand, other studies report that stricter capital requirements are not a driving factor for moving away from sustainability projects (CISL and UNEP FI 2014) Four key aspects of the global macroeconomy, each slightly different, pointed in a cascading fashion towards  a  deteriorating  environment  for  stepped-up  climate  financing  over  the  next  crucial  decade (2020–2030),  even  before  COVID-19.  The  argument  is  often  made  that  there  is  enough  climate financing  available  if  the  right  projects  and  enabling  policy  actions  (‘bankable  projects’)  present themselves (Cuntz et al. 2017; Meltzer 2018). The attention to ‘bankability’ does not however address access  and  equity  issues  (Bayliss  and  Van  Waeyenberge  2018).  Some  significant  gains  in  climate financing  at the sectoral and microeconomic level were nevertheless happening in specific segments, such as solar energy financing and labelled green bonds (although how much of such labelled financing is incremental to unlabelled financing that might have happened anyway remains uncertain) (Tolliver Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-12  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 et al. 2019). Issues of ‘labelling’ (Cornell 2020) apply even more to ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments which started to grow rapidly after 2016 (see Section 15.6.6. for more details). Overall, these increments for climate finance remained, however, small in aggregate relative to the size of  the  shifts  in  climate  financing  required  in  the  coming  decade.  Annual  energy  investments  in developing regions (other than China) which account for two-thirds of the world population, with least costs of mitigation per ton of emissions (one-half that in developed regions), and for the bulk of future expected global GHG emissions, saw a 20 percent decline in investments since 2016, and only a one-fifth  share  of  global  clean  energy  investment,  reflecting  persistent  financing  problems  and  costs  of mobilizing finance towards clean energy transition, even prior to the pandemic  (IEA 2021a). In the words of a macroeconomic institution, ‘tangible policy responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have  been  grossly  insufficient  to  date’  (IMF  2020a).  The  reason  is  in  part  global  macroeconomic headwinds, which show a relative stagnation since 2016 and limited cross-border flows in particular (Yeo 2019). Slowing and more unstable GDP growth. The first headwind was more unstable and slowing GDP growth at individual country levels and in aggregate because of worsening climate change impact events (Donadelli et al. 2019; Kahn et al. 2019). As each warmer year keep producing more negative impacts – arising from greater and rising variability and intensity of rainfall, floods, droughts, forest fires and storms – the negative consequences have become more macro-economically significant, and worst for the most climate-vulnerable developing countries (high confidence). Paradoxically, while these effects should  have  raised  the  social  returns  and  incentives  to  invest  more  in  future  climate  mitigation,  a standard public policy argument, these macroeconomic shocks may work in the opposite direction for private decisions by raising the financing costs now (Cherif and Hasanov 2018). With some climate tipping points, potentially in the near-term reach (see Chapter 4: Future global climate: scenario-based 1 projections and near-term information in WGI) the uncertainty with regard to the economic viability and  growth  prospects  of  selected  macroeconomically  critical  sectors  increases  significantly  (see Chapter 8 and Chapter 17 in WGII). Taking account of other behavioural failures, this was creating a barrier for pro-active and accelerated mitigation and adaptation action. Public finances. The second headwind was rising public fiscal costs of mitigation and adapting to rising climate  shocks  affecting  many  countries,  which  were  negatively  impacting  public  indebtedness  and country credit ratings (Cevik and Jalles 2020; Klusak et al. 2021) at a time of growing stresses on public finances and debt (Benali et al. 2018; Kling et al. 2018; Kose et al. 2020) (high confidence). Every climate shock and slowing growth puts greater pressures on public finances to offset these impacts. Crucially, the negative consequences were typically greater at the lower end of income distributions everywhere  (Acevedo  et  al.  2018;  Aggarwal  2019). As  a  result, the  standard  prescription  of  raising distributionally adverse carbon taxes and reducing fossil fuel subsidies to raise resources faced political pushback in several countries (Copland 2020; Green 2021), and low rates elsewhere. Reduced taxes on capital, by contrast, was viewed as a way to improve growth (Bhattarai et al. 2018; Font et al. 2018), and  working  against  broader fiscal  action.  Progress with carbon pricing remained modest  across  44 OECD and G20 countries, with 55-70% of all carbon emissions from energy use entirely unpriced as of 2018 (OECD 2021a). Climate vulnerable countries meanwhile faced sharply rising cost of sovereign debt. (Buhr et al. 2018). (Buhr et al. 2018) calculate the additional financing costs of Climate Vulnerable Forum countries of 40 billion USD on government debt over the past 10 years and 62 billion USD for the next 10 years. Including private financing cost the amount increases to 146–168 billion USD over the next decade.  Credit risks.  The third headwind is rising financial and insurance sector risks and stresses (distinct from real ‘physical’ climate risks above) arising from the impacts of climate change, and systematically affecting both national and international financial institutions and raising their credit risks (Dafermos et al. 2018; Rudebusch 2019; Battiston et al. 2021a) (high confidence). Central banks are beginning to take notice (Carney 2019; NGFS 2019).

Global growth. The fourth headwind entering 2020 was the sharply slowing global macroeconomic growth, and prospects for near-term recession (which occurred in the pandemic).  During global real and financial cycle downturns (Jordà et al. 2019), the perception of general financial risk rises, causing financial institutions and savers to reallocate their financing to risk-free global assets (high confidence). This ‘flight to safety’ was evident even before the recent pandemic, marked by an extraordinary tripling of financial assets to about 16.5 trillion USD in negative-interest earning ‘safer’ assets in 2019 in world debt markets – enough to have nearly closed the total financing gap in climate finance over a decade.  15.2.3 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic The macroeconomic headwinds have worsened dramatically with the onset of COVID-19. Almost two years after the pandemic started, it is still too uncertain and early to conclude impacts of the pandemic until 2025-2030, especially as they affect climate finance. Multiple waves of the pandemic, new virus mutations, accumulating human toll, and growing vaccine coverage but vastly differing access across developed versus developing regions are evident. They are causing divergent impacts across sectors and countries, which combined with the divergent ability of countries and regions to mount sufficient fiscal and monetary policy actions imply continued high uncertainty on the economic recovery paths from the crisis. The situation remains more precarious in middle and low-income developing countries (IMF 2021a). While recovery is happening, the job losses have been large, poverty rates have climbed, public health systems are suffering long-term consequences, education gains have been set back, public debt levels are higher (5-10% of GDP higher), financial institutions have come under longer-term stress, a larger number of developing countries are facing debt distress, and many key high-contact sectors such  as  tourism  and  trade  will  take  time  to  recover  (Eichengreen  et  al.  2021).    The  implication  is negative headwinds for climate finance with public attention focused on pandemic relief and recovery and limited (and divergent) fiscal headroom for a low carbon transition, with considerable uncertainties ahead (Hepburn et al. 2020b; Maffettone and Oldani 2020; Steffen et al. 2020).  The larger and still open public policy choice question that COVID-19 now raises is whether there is room for public policy globally and in respect of their individual economies to integrate climate more centrally to  their  growth,  jobs  and  sustainable  development  strategies  worldwide  for  ecological  and economic survival. The outcomes will depend on the robustness of recovery from the pandemic, and the still evolving public policy responses to the climate agenda in the recovery process. Private equity and asset markets have recovered surprisingly rapidly during the pandemic (in response to the massive fiscal and central bank actions generating large excess savings with very low or negative yields boosting stock markets). On public spending, some early studies suggest that the immediate economic recovery packages  were  falling  well  short  of  being  sufficiently  climate  sustainable  (Gosens  and  Jotzo  2020; Kuzemko et al. 2020; O’Callaghan 2021) but several governments have also announced intentions to spend more on a green recovery, a ‘build back better’ and Just Transition efforts (see Section 15.2.4), although outcomes remain highly uncertain (Lehmann et al. 2021; Markandya et al. 2021).  An important immediate finding from the COVID-19 crisis was that the slowdown in economic activity is illustrating some of these choices: immediately after the onset, more costly and carbon-intensive coal use for energy use tumbled in major countries such as China and the USA, while the forced ‘stay-at-home’ policies adopted around the major economies of the world led to a -30-35% decline in individual country GDP, and was in turn been associated with a decrease in daily global CO2 emissions by -26% at  their  peak  in individual countries,  and  -17%  globally  (-11  to  -25%  for  ±1σ)  by  early  April  2020 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-14  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 compared with the mean 2019 levels, with just under half coming from changes in surface transport, city congestion and country mobility (Le Quéré et al. 2020). Along with the carbon emissions drop was a  dramatic  improvement  in  other  parameters  such  as  clean  air  quality.  Moreover,  longer-term behavioural  impacts  are  also  possible:  a  dramatic  acceleration  of  digital  technologies  in communications, travel, retail trade and transport. The question however is whether the world might revert to the earlier carbon-intensive path of recovery, or to a different future, and the choice of policies in shaping this future. Studies generally suggest that the gains from long-term impacts of the pandemic on future global warming will be limited and depend more on the nature of public policy actions and long-term commitments by countries to raise their ambitions, not just on climate but on sustainable development broadly (Barbier 2020; Barbier and Burgess 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Gillingham et al. 2020;  Reilly  et  al. 2021). The  positive  lesson is clear: opportunities  exist for  accelerating structural change, and for a re-orientation of economic activity modes to a low-carbon use strategy in areas such as coal use in energy consumption and surface transport, city congestion and in-country mobility, for which lower-cost alternatives exist and offer potentially dramatic gains (Hepburn et al. 2020b).  A new consensus and compact towards such a structural change and economic stimulus instruments may therefore need to be redrawn worldwide, where an accelerated low carbon transition is a priority; and  accelerated  climate  finance  to  spur  these  investments  may  gain  by  becoming  fully  and  rapidly integrated with near-term economic stimulus, growth and macroeconomic strategies for governments, central banks, and private financial systems alike. If that were to happen, COVID-19 may well be a turning point for sustainable climate policy and financing. Absent that, a return to ‘business-as-usual’ modes will mean a likely down-cycle in climate financing and investments in the near-term.  Expectations that the recovery package stimulus will increase economic activity rely on the assumption that  increased  credit  investment  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  demand,  the so-called demand-led policy (Mercure et al. 2019). The argument for a green recovery also draws on the experience from the post Global Financial Crisis in 2008–2009 (GFC) recovery, in which large economies such as China, South Korea, the US and the EU observed that green investments propelled the development of new industrial  sectors.  Noticeably,  this  had  a  positive  net  effect  on  job  creation  when  compared  to  the investment in traditional infrastructure (UKERC 2014; Vona et al. 2018; Jaeger et al. 2020). For a more in-depth discussion on macroeconomic-finance possible response see Section 15.6.3. Here, we conclude with the options for reviving a better globally coordinated macroeconomic climate action. The options are some combinations of five possible elements:  (a) Reaffirmation of a strong financial agenda in future Conference of Parties’ meetings, and a new collective  finance  target,  which  will  need  to  be  undertaken  by  2025.  Given  that  the  shortfalls  in financing  are  likely  to  be  acute  for  developing  regions  and  especially  the  more  debt-stressed  and vulnerable  (Dibley  et  al.  2021;  Elkhishin and  Mohieldin  2021;  Laskaridis  2021;  Umar  et  al.  2021), developed  countries  may  wish  to  step  up  their  collective  support  (Resano  and  Gallego  2021).  One possibility is to expedite the new SDR issuance allocation rules for the 650 billion USD recently (2021) approved, most of which will go to increase the reserves of G-7 and other High-Income countries unless voluntarily  reallocated  towards  the  needs  of  the  most  vulnerable  low-income  countries,  raising resources  potentially  ‘larger  than  the  Marshall  Plan  in  today’s  money’  (IMF  2021b;  Jensen  2021; Obstfeld and Truman 2021), with decisions to be taken (Ameli et al. 2021a) note the climate investment trap of current high cost of finance that effectively lowers green electricity production possibilities in Africa  for  a  cost  optimal  pathway.  Other  initiatives  could  also  include  G-7  and  G-20  governments (especially  with  the  lead  taken  by  the  developed  members  for  cross-border  support  to  avoid  over-burdening public resources in developing countries) running coordinated fiscal deficits to accelerate the financing of low carbon investments (‘green fiscal stimulus’). (b)  introducing  new  actions,  including  regulatory,  to  take  some  of  the  risks  off-the-table  from institutional  financial  players  investing  in  climate  mitigation  investment  and  insurance.

(c) facilitating and incentivizing much larger flows of cross-border climate financing which is especially crucial for such investments to happen in developing regions, where as much as two-thirds of collective investment may need to happen (IEA 2021a), and where the role of multilateral, regional and global institutions such as the IMF (including the expansion in availability of climate SDRs referred earlier) could be important.  (d)  global  central  banks  acting  in  coordination  to  include  climate  finance  as  intrinsic  part  of  their monetary policy and stimulus (Carney 2019; Jordà et al. 2019; Hilmi et al. 2021; Schoenmaker 2021; Svartzman et al. 2021)  (e) an acceleration of Just Transition initiatives, outlined further below (Section 15.2.4). 15.2.4 Climate Finance and Just Transition Climate finance in support of a Just Transition is likely to be a key to a successful low-carbon transition globally  (high  confidence).  Ambitious  global  climate  agreements  are  likely  to  work  far  better  by maximising cooperative arrangements (IPCC 2018; Gazzotti et al. 2021) with greater financing support from developed to developing regions in recognition of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ and a greater ethical sense of climate justice (Khan et al. 2020; Sardo 2020; Warner 2020; Pearson et al. 2021). While Just Transition issues apply within developed countries as well (see later discussion), these are of relatively second-order significance to addressing climate justice issues between richer and poorer countries – given the scale of financing and existing social safety nets in the former and their absence in the latter. For example, over the past three decades drought in Africa has caused more climate-related mortality than all climate-related events combined from the rest of the world  (Warner  2020).  These  issues  can  however  serve  both  as  a  bridge  and  a  barrier  to  greater cooperation on climate change. The key is to build greater mutual trust with clearer commitments and well-structured key decisions and instruments (Sardo 2020; Pearson et al. 2021).  The Just Transition discussion has picked up steam. It was explicitly recognised in the Paris Agreement and the 2018 Just Transition Declaration signed by 53 countries at COP24, which ‘recognised the need to factor in the needs of workers and communities to build public support for a rapid shift to a zero-carbon economy.’ Originally proposed by global trade unions in the 1980s, the recent discourse has become broader. It has coalesced into  a more inclusive process to reduce inequality across all three areas of energy, environment and climate (McCauley and Heffron 2018; Bainton et al. 2021). It seeks accelerated public policy support to ensure environmental sustainability, decent work, social inclusion and poverty eradiation (Burrow 2017), widely shared benefits, and protection of indigenous rights, and livelihoods of communities and workers who stand to lose (including workers in fossil fuel sectors such as  coal  and  oil  and  gas)  (UNFCCC  2018b;  EBRD  2020;  Jenkins  et  al.  2020).  Because  the  process involves ‘climate justice’ and equity within and across generations, it involves difficult political trade-offs (Newell and Mulvaney 2013). The implications for a Just Transition in climate finance are clear: expanding equitable and greater access to climate finance for vulnerable countries, communities and sectors, not just for the most profitable private investment opportunities, and a larger role for public finance in fulfilling existing finance commitments (Bracking and Leffel 2021; Kuhl 2021; Long 2021; Roberts et al. 2021) .  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-16  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Large shocks, such as pandemics and slow-growing one such as climate are typically known to worsen inequality (IMF and World Bank 2020). Evidence from 133 countries between 2001–2018 suggests that such shocks can cause social unrest, and migration pressures, especially when starting inequality is high and  social  transfers  are  low    (Saadi  Sedik  and  Xu  2020).  Additionally,  climate  policies  are  more politically difficult to implement, when the setting is one of high inequality but much less politically costly where incomes are more evenly distributed with stronger social safety nets (Furceri et al. 2021). A redrawn social compact incorporating climate (Beck et al. 2021) that would adopt redistributive taxes and lower carbon consumption, and strengthen state capacity to deliver safety nets, health, education with accelerated climate and environmental sustainability within and across countries is increasingly recognised as important. Countries, regions and coordination bodies of the larger countries (G-7, G-20) have  already  begun  such  as  shift  to  financing  of  a  Just  Transition,  but  primarily  focused  on  the developed countries, although gaps remain (Krawchenko and Gordon 2021).  Such a redrawing of a social compact has happened  significantly in the past, for example, after the 1860s ‘gilded age of capital’ with the enlargement of the franchise in democratization waves in Europe and the Americas (Dasgupta and Ziblatt 2015, 2016). Not only was social conflict avoided but growth outcomes became more equitable and faster.  Similarly, comprehensive modern social safety nets and progressive taxation, which started in the Great Depression and was extended in the post-war period, had both a positive pro-growth and lower inequality effects (Brida et al. 2020) .  There are three levels of at which policy attention on climate financing now may need to be focused. The first is the need for to addressing the global equity issues in climate finance in a more carefully constructed globally cooperative public policy approach. The second is to address issues appropriately with enhanced support, at the national level. The third is to work it down further, to addressing needs at  local  community  levels.  Because  private  investors  and  financing  mostly  deal  with  allocation  to climate  finance  at  a  global  portfolio  level,  then  to  allocation  by  countries,  and  finally  to  individual projects, the challenge for them is to refocus attention to Just Transition issues at the country level, but also globally as well as locally (in other words, at all three levels). Climate finance will likely face greater challenges in the post-pandemic context (Hanna et al. 2020; Henry et al. 2020). Evidence from COVID-19 pandemic suggests that those in greatest vulnerability often had the least access to human, physical, and financial resources  (Ruger and Horton 2020). It has also left  in  in  its  wake  divergent  prospects for  economic  recovery,  with  rising constraints  on  credit ratings  and  costly  debt  burden  in  many  developing  countries  contrasted  with  the  exceptionally  low interest  rate  settings  in  developed  economies  driving  the  limited  fiscal  space  in  the  former  groups (Benmelech  and  Tzur-Ilan  2020).  Similarly,  monetary  policies  are  likely  to  be  much  tighter  in developing  countries  in  part  structurally  because  of  the  absence  of  ‘exceptional  privilege’  of  global reserve currencies in developed economies.  The result is a divergence in recovery prospects in the aftermath of the pandemic, with output losses (compared  to  potential)  set  to  worsen  in  developing  economies  (excluding  China)  as  compared  to developed  countries  (IMF  2020b).  In  these  circumstances,  a  coordinated  and  cooperative  approach, instead  of  unilateralism,  might  work  better  (McKibbin  and  Vines  2020).  In  the  case  of  climate, simulations clearly suggest the need and advantages of better coordinated climate action with stepped-up Paris Agreement envisaged transfers (IMF 2020b). Several options in international climate finance arrangements to support a Just Transition are both available and urgent.  As a first priority, measures might need to accelerate a mix of equitable financial grants, low-interest loans, guarantees and workable business models access across countries and borders, from developed countries to in low-income countries. A big push on low-carbon energy access globally, especially in large low-income regions such as Africa, with accelerated financial transfers makes sense  (Boamah 2020).  For about one billion people globally at the base of the pyramid without access to modern low-carbon energy access, such an action, with enormous immediate leap-frogging potential, would be a Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-17  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 key pathway to achieve the SDGs, ensure that high-carbon energy use is avoided, such as the burning of  biomass  and  forests  for  charcoal,  and  improve  air  quality  and  public  health,  especially  women’s health (van der Zwaan et al. 2018; Nathwani and Kammen 2019; Dalla Longa and van der Zwaan 2021; Michaelowa et al. 2021; Osabuohien et al. 2021).  A second priority is to accelerate the implementation of the 100 billion USD a year (and likely more given  growing  financing  gaps)  in  climate  finance  commitments  expressed  in  the  Copenhagen Agreement Accord (and reiterated since) from developed to developing countries, and to build greater confidence by agreeing rapidly on key definitions.  Shifting to a grant equivalent net flows definition of climate finance, which is now universally accepted for all other aid flows by all parties since 2014 and which took effect since 2019 on every other public international good finance provision (under the SDGs), with the sole exception of climate finance, would resolve many uncertainties: the disbursement of climate finance flows on a grant equivalent basis that is comparable across institutions, instruments and countries, and measurement with greater accuracy about the effective transfer of resources. The journey to get to a clear and precise definition of net Official Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) took time. The original proposal was first initiated in the 1960s (Pincus 1963) but it was not till MDB’s and  others  laid  out  the  compelling  reasons  why  (Chang  et  al.  1998)  that  this  was  accomplished: especially to resolve decades of confusion and inconsistency between different types of financial flows and hence the perennial measurement problems and ‘the compromise between political expediency and statistical reality’ (Bulow and Rogoff 2005; Hynes and Scott 2013; Scott 2015, 2017).  A  third  related  and  increasingly  crucial  priority  is  to  expedite  the  operational  definition  of  blended finance and promote the use of public guarantee instruments. Private flows to accelerate the low-carbon transition  in  developing  countries  would  benefit  enormously,  by  gaining  clearer  access  to  public international funds and support defined on a grant equivalent basis, provided development and climate finance  operational  definitions  and  procedures  were  improved  on  an  urgent  basis  (Blended  Finance Taskforce 2018a; OECD-DAC 2021). When blended and supported by public finance and policy, the grant equivalency measure can easily and more accurately measure the value and benefit of blended public  and  private  finance  by  comparing  the  effective  interest  cost  (and  volume)  gain  with  such financing, against the benchmark costs without such blending. Here again, a pressing challenge is to improve the operational definitions of what counts as ODA within blended finance. Blended finance remains very poorly defined and accounted (Pereira 2017; Andersen et al. 2019; Attridge and Engen 2019; Basile and Dutra 2019). Guarantees are expressly not included in the definition of ODA (Garbacz et al. 2021), As a result, bilateral and multilateral agencies have no incentive or limited authority and basis to use such instruments, while multilateral development banks continue to approach guarantees with  great  caution  because  of  the  limits  of  their  original  charters  (World  Bank  2009)  and  require counter-indemnities by recipient countries, internal and historic agency inertia, perceived loss of control over the use of funds (compared to their preferred direct project-based lending) and employ restrictive accounting rules for capital provisioning of guarantees at 100% of their face value to maintain AAA ratings with credit rating agencies (Humphrey 2017; Pereira dos Santos and Kearney 2018a; Bandura and Ramanujam 2019; Hourcade et al. 2021a). Largely because of such official uncertainty the actual flows of blended finance and guarantees continue to remain a very small share (typically, less than 5%) of official and multilateral finance flows to lower project risks and costs, and hence the potential for large-scale accelerated low-carbon private investments in developing countries. Public guarantees can offer  a  fifteen  times  multiplier  effect  on  the  scale  of  low-carbon  investments  generated  with  such support, compared to a 1:1 ratio in direct financing (Hourcade et al. 2021a). It makes sense to expedite these operational procedures (Khan et al. 2020) which cannot be otherwise explained except in terms of avoiding responsibilities, even where the benefits would be high (Klöck et al. 2018). It also causes (unnecessary) fragmentation and complexity and often ‘strategic’ ambiguity by many  actors  (Pickering  et al. 2017),  which  worsens the  possibilities for  international  cooperation,  a critical requirement to achieve the Paris goals (IPCC 2018).

The absence of such a collective decision continues to be exceptionally costly for the implementation of the Paris Agreement because of the fractious and seemingly insoluble negotiating climate and a breakdown of trust that this has created (Roberts and Weikmans 2017).  A fourth priority is on expanding jobs and dealing with job losses in the global low carbon transition (Carley  and  Konisky  2020;  Crowe  and  Li  2020;  Pai et  al.  2020;  Cunningham  and  Schmillen  2021; Hanto et al. 2021), especially in coal and other sectors, as well as land and other effects for indigenous communities (Zografos and Robbins 2020). Many countries, especially low-income countries, remain dependent on fossil fuels for their energy and exports and jobs, and support for their transition to a low-carbon  future  will  be  essential.  Global  recovery  from  the  pandemic  will  take  longer  than  initially envisaged (IMF 2021c; OECD 2021b) and  an accelerated climate action for a Build Back Better global infrastructure  plan  with  better  and  more  resilient  jobs  might  play  a  key  role  as  part  of  the  Just Transitions. Already, there is substantial evidence (Sulich et al. 2020; Dell’Anna 2021; Dordmond et al. 2021) that a more sustainable climate path would generate many more net productive jobs (with much  higher  employment  multipliers  and  mutual  gains  from  given  spending)  than  would  any  other large-scale  alternative.  But  this  would  nevertheless  require  a  carefully  managed  transition  globally, including access to much larger volumes of climate financing in developing economies (Muttitt and Kartha 2020). The multilateral finance institutions have generally played a supportive role, expanding their financing to developing countries during the pandemic (even as bilateral aid flows have fallen sharply), but have been hampered by the of constraints on their mandates and instruments (as noted earlier).  Political  leadership  and  direction  will  be  again  crucial  to  enhance  their  roles.  The  recent expansion of SDR quotas at the IMF similarly might help, but the current distributions of quota benefits flow primarily to the developed countries and does little to expand investment flows on a longer-term basis for a global expansion in growth and job opportunities in the low-carbon transition.  As a fifth priority, transformative climate financing options based on equity and global sustainability objectives  may  also  need  to  consider  a  greater  mix  of  public  pricing  and  taxation  options  on  the consumption side (Arrow et al. 2004; Folke et al. 2021). Two-thirds of global GHG emissions directly or indirectly are linked to household consumption, with average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe of 13.4 and 7.5 tCo2-eq/capita, respectively, compared to 1.7 in Africa and Middle East  (Gough  2020)  and  as  high  as  200tCO2-eq/capita  among  the  top  1%  in  some  high-income geographies  versus  0.1tCO2-eq  at  the  other  end  of  the  income  distribution  in  some  least-developed countries  (Chancel and Piketty 2015).  Globally, the highest-expenditure households account for eleven times the per capita emissions of lowest-expenditure households, with rising carbon income elasticities that  suggest  ‘redistribution  of  carbon  shares  from  global  elites  to  global  poor’  as  welfare  efficient (Chancel and Piketty 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017). Within countries and regions, and within sectors, similar patterns hold. The top 10% of the population with the highest per capita footprints account for 27% of the EU carbon footprint, and the top 1% have a carbon footprint of 55tCO2-eq/cap, with air transport  the  most  elastic,  unequal  and  carbon-intensive  consumption  (Ivanova  and  Wood  2020). Similarly, within sectors, there are large differences in carbon-intensity in the building sector in North America (Goldstein et al. 2020) and across cities where consumption-based GHG emissions vary widely across the world (ranging from 1.8 to 25.9 tCO2-eq/capita). Numerous options exist (Broeks et al. 2020; Nyfors et al. 2020) for such carbon consumption reduction measures,  while  potentially  improving  societal  well-being,  for  example:  (a)  inner-city  zoning restrictions  on  private  cars  and  promoting  walking/bicycle  use  and  improved  shared  low-carbon transport  infrastructure;  (b)  advertising  regulation  and  carbon  taxes  and  fees  on  high-carbon  luxury status goods and services; (c) subsidies and exemptions for low-carbon options, higher value-added taxes on specific high-carbon products and services, subsidies for public low-carbon options such as commuter  transport,  and  other  behavioural  nudges  (Reisch  et  al.  2021);  and  (d)  framing  options (emphasizing total cost of car over life-times), mandatory smart metering, collective goods and services (leasing, renting, sharing  options)  and  others.

These five options identified above on near-term actions and priorities will however, require greater collective political leadership. A review of past crisis episodes suggests that collective actions to avoid large global or multi-country risks work well primarily when the problems are well-defined, a small number of actors are involved, solutions are relatively well-established scientifically, and public costs to address them are relatively small (Sandler 1998, 2015) (for example, dealing with early pandemic outbreaks such as Ebola, TB, and cholera; extending global vaccination programs such as smallpox, measles  and  polio;  early  warning  systems  and  actions  such  as  tsunamis,  hurricanes/cyclones  and volcanic disasters; Montreal Protocol for ozone depleting refrigerants, and renewables wind and solar energy development). They but do not appear to work as well for more complex global collective action problems  which  concern  a  number  of  economic  actors,  sectors,  without  inexpensive  and  mature technological options, and where political and institutional governance is fragmented. Greater political coordination  is  needed  because  the  impacts  are  often  not  near-term  or  imminent,  but  diffuse,  slow-moving and long-term, and where preventive disaster avoidance is costly even when these costs are low compared to the longer-term damages—till tipping points are reached of the need for reduced ‘stressors’ and increasing ‘facilitators’ (Jagers et al. 2020). But by then, it may be too late. Private institutional investors equally might equally wish to pay greater attention to the Just Transition finance issues. It would be useful for investors to identify ways to support to such initiatives, and more clearly identifying the benefits of such transition measures envisaged by both countries and investment financing proposals,  including incorporating Just Transition consideration in their support to broader ESG (environmental, social and governance) and green financing initiatives. The second level of attention needed on Just Transitions has to do with inequities within a large country setting, developed or developing. The Just Transition issue exists within developed countries as well. As the ongoing pandemic illustrates, the first climate burden hit is often felt most acutely at the level of states and cities, with many smaller ones without enough fiscal capacity or ability to mount an adequate discretionary  counter  policy.  Only  national  governments  have  ability  to  borrow more  in  their  fiscal accounts to address large collective problems, whether pandemics or climate change. Therefore, it is important that national policies and funds be available for programs to address the Just Transition issues for  larger  sub-national  states,  cities  and  regions.  This  would  be  helped  by  countries  including  Just Transition initiatives in their NDCs for financing (as South Africa has recently done), and attention by external  financing  agencies  and  MDBs  to  large-scale  adverse  impacts  in  their  climate  policies  and investments. For example, the EU Green Deal plans (Nae and Panie 2021) includes several initiatives (focusing on industries, regions and workers adversely affected with explicit programs to address them).  The third level of argument is for a shift in focus from an exclusive attention to financing of mitigation and low-carbon new investments projects to also better understanding and addressing the local adverse impacts  of  climate  change  on  communities  and  people,  who  are  vulnerable  and  increasingly dispossessed due to losses and damages from climate change or even those who are impacted by de-carbonization measures in the fossil fuel sectors, transportation, as well as those who are harmed by polluting sectors: indigenous men and women, minorities and generally the poor. It is evident that very few resources are available to countries, investors, civil society, and smaller development institutions seeking to achieve a just transition  (Robins and Rydge 2020).

This section provides aggregate level reference points of relevance to the remainder of this Chapter, notably when assessing current levels of climate and fossil fuel-related  investments  and  financing  (Sections  15.3.2.3  and  15.3.2.4  respectively),  as  well  as estimates investment and financing needed to meet climate objectives (Section 15.4). Measures of financial flows and stocks provide complementary and interrelated insights into trends over time: the accumulation of flows, measured per unit of time, results in stocks, observed at a given point in time (IMF 2009; UN and ECB 2015). On the flows side, GDP, a System of National Accounts (SNA) statistical standard that measures the monetary value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time. In 2020, global GDP represented above 70 trillion USD2015 (down from almost 80 trillion USD in 2019), out of which developed countries represented approx. 60% (Figure 15.1); a slowly decreasing share over the last years. The GDP metric is useful here as an indicator of the level of activity of an economy but gives no indication relating to human wellbeing or SDG achievements (Giannetti  et  al.  2015)  counts  positively  activities  that  negatively  impact  the  environment,  without making deductions for the depletion and degradation of natural resources.

Global GFCF represents about a quarter of global GDP, a relatively stable ratio since 2008. This share is, however, much higher for emerging economies, notably in Asia, which are building new infrastructure at scale. As analysed in Sections 15.4 and 15.5, infrastructure investment needs and gaps in developing countries are significant.

Bonds, a form of debt financing, represent a significant share of total financial assets. As of August 2020, the overall size of the global bond markets (amount outstanding) was estimated at approximately 128.3 trillion USD, out of which over two thirds from “supranational, sovereign, and agencies”, and just under a third from corporations (ICMA 2020b). As discussed later in the Chapter, since AR5, an increasing number and volume of bonds have been earmarked for climate action but these still only represent less than 1% of the total bond market. As of end 2020, climate aligned bonds outstanding were estimated at 0.9 trillion (Giorgi and Michetti 2021), though already raising concerns in  terms  of  both  underlying  definitions  (Section  15.6.6)  and  risks  of  increased  climate-related indebtedness (Section 15.6.1, 15.6.3).  From the perspective of climate change action, these orders of magnitude make it possible to highlight the relatively small size of current climate finance flows and relatively larger size of remaining fossil fuel-related finance flows (discussed in the following two sub-sections), as well as, more generally, the significant overall scale of financial flows and stocks that have to be made consistent with climate goals. These orders of magnitude further make it possible to put in perspective climate-related investment needs (Section 15.4) and gaps (Section 15.5). 15.3.2   Estimates of climate finance flows The  measurement  of  climate  finance  flows  continues  to  face  similar  definitional,  coverage  and reliability issues than at the time of AR5 and special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C, despite progress  made (more  sources,  greater  frequency,  and some  definitional improvements) by  a range of data providers and collators. Based on available estimates (Table 1 and Figure 3), flows of annual global climate finance are on an upward trend since AR5, reaching a high-bound estimate of 681 billion USD in 2016 (UNFCCC 2018a). Latest available estimates, indicate a drop in 2018 (Buchner et al.  2019)  and  a  rebound  in  2019  and  2020  (Naran  et  al.  2021)  (medium  confidence).

At an aggregate level, in both developed and developing countries, the vast majority of tracked climate finance is sourced from domestic or national markets rather than cross-border financing (Buchner et al. 2019). This reinforces the point that national policies and settings remain crucial (Section 15.6.2), along with the development of local capital markets (Section 15.6.7).  Climate finance in developing countries remains heavily concentrated in a few large economies (high confidence), with Brazil, India, China and South Africa accounting for 25% to 43% depending on the year, a share similar to that represented by developed countries. Least-developed countries (LDCs), on the  other  hand,  continue to  represent  less than  5%  year-on-year  (BNEF  2019;  Buchner  et  al.  2019) 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-23  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS          Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 (medium confidence). Further, the relatively modest growth of climate finance in developed countries is a matter of concern given that economic circumstances are, in most cases, relatively more amenable to greater financing, savings and affordability than in developing countries. At a global level, the majority of tracked climate finance is assessed as coming from private actors (Buchner et al. 2019), although, as discussed in Box 15.2, the boundaries between private and public finance include significant grey zones, which implies that different definitions could lead to different conclusions (for instance see (Yeo 2019; Weikmans and Roberts 2019) ). However, private investments in  climate  projects  and  activities  often  benefit  from  public  support  in  the  form  of  co-financing, guarantees or fiscal measures. In terms of financial instruments and mechanisms, debt as well as balance sheet  financing  (which  can  rely  on  both  own  resources  and  further  debt)  and  project  financing (combining a large debt portion and smaller equity portion) represent the lion’s share. In this context, the rapid rise of climate-related bond issuances since AR5 (Giorgi and Michetti 2021)  represents an opportunity for scaling up climate finance but also poses underlying issues of integrity  (Nicol et al. 2018a;  Shishlov  et  al.  2018)  and  additionality  (Schneeweiss  2019),  as  further  discussed  in  Section 15.6.6, as well as needs to be considered in the context of overall indebtedness and debt sustainability (Sections 15.6.1, 15.6.3). Mitigation continues to represent the lion’s share of global climate finance  (between 90% and 95% between  2017  and  2020),  and  in  particular  renewable  energy,  followed  by  energy  efficiency  and transport (UNFCCC 2018a; Buchner et al. 2019) (high confidence). While capacity additions on the ground kept rising, falling technology costs in certain sectors (e.g. solar energy) has had a negative impact on the year-on-year trend that can be observed in terms of volumes of climate finance (IRENA 2019a; BNEF 2019). However, such cost reduction could free up investment and financing capacities for potential use in other climate-related activities.  Tracking  adaptation  finance  continues  to  pose  significant  challenges  in  terms  of  data  and  methods. Notably, the mainstreaming of resilience into investments and business decisions makes it difficult to identify relevant activities within financial datasets (Agrawala et al. 2011; Averchenkova et al. 2016)  (Brown  et  al.  2015).  Despite  these  limitations,  evidence  shows  that  finance  for  adaptation  remains fragmented and significantly below rapidly rising needs (Section 15.4 and WG2, TSU please confirm). Further, there is increasing awareness about the need to better understand and address the interlinkages between  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster-risk-reduction  (DRR)  towards  achieving  resilience (OECD 2020a). (Watson et al. 2015) however, notes that between 2003 and 2014 of the 2 billion USD that flowed through dedicated climate change adaptation funds, only 369 million USD explicitly went to DRR activities (Climate Funds Update 2014; Nakhooda et al. 2014a,b; Watson et al. 2015). For the private  sector,  insurance  and  reinsurance  remain  the  dominant  way  to  transfer  risk,  as  discussed  in Section 15.6.4). More generally, significant gaps remain to track climate finance comprehensively at a global level:  •  Available estimates are based on a good coverage of investments in renewable energy and, where available, energy efficiency and transport, while other sectors remain more difficult to track, such as industry, agriculture and land use (UNFCCC 2018a; Buchner et al. 2019). (high confidence)  • In  contrast  to  international  public  climate  finance,  domestic  public  finance  data  remain  partial despite initiatives to track domestic climate finance (e.g. (Hainaut and Cochran 2018)) and public expenditures  (for  instance  based  on  the  UNDP’s  Climate  Public  Expenditure  and  Institutional Review approach). (high confidence) Data  on  private  and  commercial  finance  remains  very  patchy,  particularly  for  corporate  financing (including debt financing provided by commercial banks), for which it is difficult to establish a link with activities and projects on the ground.

Such data gaps as well as varying definitions of what qualifies as “climate” (or more broadly as “green” and  “sustainable”)  not  only  pose  a  measurement  challenge.  They  also  result  in  a  lack  of  clarity  for investors  and  financiers  seeking  climate-related  opportunities.  Such  uncertainty  can  lead  both  to reduced  climate  finance  as  well  as  to  a  lack  of  transparency  in  climate-related  reporting  (further discussed in Section 15.6.1), which in turn further hinders reliable measurement.  In terms of finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for climate action in developing countries, while accounting scope and methodologies continue to be debated (see Box 15.4), progress has been achieved on these matters in the context of the UNFCCC (UNFCCC 2019b). A consensus, however, exists, on a need to further scale up public finance and improve its effectiveness in mobilising private finance (OECD 2020b), as well as to further prioritise adaptation financing, in particular towards the most vulnerable countries (Carty et al.  2020). The relatively low share of adaptation in international climate finance to date may in part due to a low level of obligation and precision in global adaptation rules and commitments  (Hall  and  Persson  2018).  Further,  providers  of international  climate finance may have more incentive to support mitigation over adaptation as mitigation benefits are global while the benefits of adaptation are local or regional (Abadie et al. 2013).   ‘START BOX 15.4 HERE’ Box 15.4 Measuring progress towards the 100 billion USD yr-1 by 2020 goal - issues of method In  2009,  at  COP15,  Parties  to  the  UNFCCC  agreed  the  following:  “In  the  context  of  meaningful mitigation  actions  and  transparency  on  implementation,  developed  countries  commit  to  a  goal  of mobilizing jointly 100 billion USD dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. This goal is further embedded as a target under SDG 13 Climate Action  Such finance may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance.” (UNFCCC 2009). While the parameters for what and how to count were not defined when the goal was set, progress in this area has been achieved under the UNFCCC (UNFCCC 2019b) and via a UN-driven independent expert review (Bhattacharya et al. 2020).  There remains well documented interpretations and debates on how to account for progress (Clapp et al.  2012;  Stadelmann  et  al.  2013;  Jachnik  et  al.  2015;  Weikmans  and  Roberts  2019).  Different interpretations relate mainly to the type and proportion of activities that may qualify as “climate” on the one hand, and to how to account for different types of finance (and financial  instruments) on the other hand. As an example, there are different points at which financing can be measured, e.g. pledges, commitments, disbursements. There can be significant lags between these different points in time, e.g. disbursements may spread over time. Further, the choice of point of measurement can have an impact on both the volumes and on the characteristics (geographical origin, labelling as public or private) of the  finance  tracked.  The  enhanced  transparency  framework  under  the  Paris  Agreement  may  lead  to improvements and more consensus in the way climate finance is accounted for and reported under the UNFCCC. Available analyses specifically aimed at assessing progress towards the 100 billion USD goal  remain  rare,  e.g.  the  UNFCCC  SCF  Biennial  Assessments  do  not  directly  address  this  point (UNFCCC 2018a). Dedicated OECD reports provide figures based on accounting for gross flows of climate  finance  based  on  analysing  activity-level  data  recorded  by  the  UNFCCC  (bilateral  public climate finance) and the OECD (multilateral public climate finance, mobilised private climate finance and climate-related export credits) (OECD 2015a, 2019a, 2020b). For 2018, the OECD analysis resulted in a total of 78.9 billion USD, out of which 62.2 billion USD of public finance, 2.1 billion  USD of export credits and 14.5 billion USD of private finance mobilised. Mitigation represented 73% of the total, adaptation 19% and cross-cutting activities 8%. Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-25  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII Reports by Oxfam provide a complementary view on public climate finance, building on OECD figures and underlying data sources to translate gross flows of bilateral and multilateral public climate finance in  grant  equivalent  terms,  while  also,  for  some  activities,  applying  discounts  to  the  proportion considered as climate finance (Carty et al. 2016; Carty and Le Comte 2018 and Carty et al 2020). The resulting annual averages for 2015– 2016 and 2017–2018range between 32% (low bound) and 44% (high bound) of gross public climate finance. The difference with OECD figures stems from the high share represented by loans, both concessional and non-concessional, in public climate finance, i.e. 74% in 2018 2018 (OECD 2020b). A point of method that attracts much attention relates to how to account for private finance mobilised. The OECD, through its Development Assistance Committee, established an international standard to measure private finance mobilised by official development finance, which consists in methods tailored to different financial mechanisms. These methods taking into account the role of, risk taken, and/or amount  provided  by  all  official  actors  involved  in  a  given  project,  including  recipient  country institutions, thereby also avoiding risks of double counting. (OECD 2019b). MDBs apply a different method (World Bank 2018a) in their joint climate finance reporting (AfDB et al. 2020)., which neither correspond to the geographical scope of the 100 billion USD goal, nor address the issue of attribution to the extent required in that context.  Notwithstanding methodological discussions under the UNFCCC, there is still some distance from the 100  billion  USD  a  year  commitment  being  achieved,  including  in  terms  of  further  prioritising adaptation. While the scope of the commitment corresponds to only a fraction of the larger sums needed (Section 15.4), its fulfilment can both contribute to climate action in developing countries as well as to trust building in international climate negotiations. Combined with further clarity on geographical and sectoral  gaps,  this  can,  in  turn,  facilitate  the  implementation  of  better-coordinated  and  cooperative arrangements for mobilising funds (Peake and Ekins 2017).  ‘END BOX 15.4 HERE’ 15.3.3   Fossil fuel-related and transition finance  As called for by Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement and introduced in Section 15.3.1, achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial  levels  requires  making  all  finance  consistent  with  this  goal.  Data  on  investments  and financing to high GHG activities remain very partial and difficult to access, as relevant actors currently have  little  incentive  or  obligations  to  disclose  such  information  compared  to  reporting  on  and communicating  about  their  activities  contributing  to  climate  action.  Further,  the  development  of methodologies to assess finance for activities misaligned with climate mitigation goals, for hard- and costly-to-abate  sectors  such  as  heavy  industries,  as  well  as  for  activities  that  eventually  need  to  be phased  out  but  can  play  a  transition  role  for  given  period,  remain  work  in  progress.  This  results  in limited empirical evidence to date. Scenarios compatible with a 1.5°C warming, however, make it clear that the share of fossil fuels  in energy supply has to decrease. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 scenario relies on halting sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars by 2035, rapid and steady decrease of the production of coal (minus 90%), oil (minus 75%) and natural gas (minus 55%) by 2050, and phasing out all unabated coal and oil power plants by 2040 (IEA 2021b). To avoid locking GHG emissions incompatible with remaining carbon budgets, this implies a rapid scaling down of new fossil  fuel-related  investments,  combined  with  a  scaling  up  of  financing  to  allow  energy  and infrastructure systems to transition (high confidence). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-26  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 The IEA provides comprehensive analyses of global energy investments, estimated at about 1.8 trillion USD a year over 2017–2019 (IEA 2019a, 2020a), and expected to reach that level again in 2021 after a drop to about 1.6 trillion in 2020  (IEA 2021c). Energy investments represent about 8% of global GFCF (Section 15.3.2.1). In the power sector, fossil fuel-related investments reached an estimated 120 billion USD yr-1 on average over 2019–2020, which remains well above the level that underpin the IEA’s own Paris-compatible Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and Net Zero scenarios. The IEA observes a  similar  inconsistency  with  for  supply  side  new  investments:  in  2019-2020  on  average  yr-1,  an estimated 650 billion USD were invested in oil supply and close to 100 billion USD in coal supply. These estimates also result in fossil fuel investments remaining larger in aggregate than the total tracked climate finance worldwide (Section 15.3.2.2). For oil and gas companies, which are amongst the world largest corporations and sometimes government owned or backed, low-carbon solutions are estimated to represent less than 1% of capital expenditure  (IEA 2020b). As discussed in the remainder of this Chapter, shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities, as well as the availability of financing to finance such a transition. In terms of financing provided to fossil fuel investments, available analyses point out to a still significant role played by commercial banks and export credit agencies. Commercial banks provide both direct lending as well as underwriting services, the latter facilitating capital raising from investors in the form of bond or share issuance. Available estimates indicate that lending and underwriting extended over 2016 –2019 by 35 of the world’s largest banks to 2,100 companies active across the fossil fuel life cycle, reached USD 687 billion yr-1 on average (Rainforest Action Network et al. 2020). Official export credit  agencies,  which  are  owned  or  backed  by  their  government,  de-risk  exports  by  providing guarantees and insurances or, less often, loans. In 2016–2018, available estimates indicate the provision of about 31 billion USD yr-1 worth of fossil fuel-related official export credits, out of which close to 80% for the oil and gas, and over 20% for coal DeAngelis and Tucker  2020).  Finance for new fossil fuel-related assets lock in future GHG emissions that may be inconsistent with remaining  carbon  budgets  and,  as  discussed  above,  with  emission  pathways  to  reach  the  Paris Agreement goals. This inconsistency exposes investors and asset owners to the risk of stranded assets, which results from potential sharp strengthening climate public policies, i.e. transition risk. As a result, a growing number of investors and financiers are assessing climate-related risks with the aim to disclose information about their current level of exposure (to both transition and physical climate-related risks), as well as to inform their future decisions (TCFD 2017). Reporting to date is, however, inconsistent across geographies and jurisdictions (CDSB and CDP 2018; Perera et al. 2019), with also a wide variety of  metrics,  methodologies,  and  approaches  developed  by  commercial  providers  that  contribute  to disparate outcomes (Kotsantonis and Serafeim 2019; Boffo and Patalano 2020). Further, as developed in Sections 15.6.1, there is currently not enough evidence in order to conclude whether climate-related risk  assessments  result  in  increased  climate  action  and  alignment  with  the  goals  of  the  Paris Agreement(e.g. 2° Investing Initiative (The 2°Investing Initiative and Wuest Partner 2020)). As developed in Section 15.6.3, the insufficient level of ambition and coherence of public policies at national and international level remains the root cause of the still significant misalignment of investment and financing compared to pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature goal  (UNEP 2018). Such lack of coherence includes low pricing of carbon and of environmental externalities more generally, as well as misaligned policies in non-climate policy areas such as fiscal, trade, industrial and investment policy, and financial regulation (OECD 2015b), as further specified in the sectoral Chapters 6 to 12.  The most documented policy misalignment relates to the remaining very large scale of public direct and indirect financial support for fossil fuel-related production and consumption in many parts of the world (Bast et al. 2015; Coady et al. 2017; Climate Transparency 2020). Fossil fuel subsidies are embedded Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-27  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII across economic sectors as well as policy areas, e.g. from a trade policy perspective, in most countries, import tariffs and non-tariff barriers are substantially lower on relatively more CO2 intensive industries (Shapiro 2020). Available inventories of fossil fuel subsidies (in the form of direct budgetary transfers, revenue forgone, risk transfers, or induced transfers), covering 76 economies, indicate a rise to USD 340 billion in 2017, a 5% increase compared to 2016. Such trend is due to slowed down progress in reducing support among OECD and G20 economies in 2017 (OECD 2018b) and to a rise in fossil-fuel subsidies for consumption in several developing economies (Matsumura and Adam 2019), which, in turn, reduces the efficiency of public instruments and incentives aimed at redirecting investments and financing towards low-GHG activities.  As a result, the demand for fossil fuels, especially in the energy production, transport and buildings sectors, remain high, and the risk-return profile of fossil fuel-related investments it still positive in many instance (Hanif et al. 2019). Political economy constraints of fossil fuel subsidy reform continue to be a  major  hurdle  for  climate  action  (Schwanitz  et  al.  2014;  Röttgers  and  Anderson  2018),  as  further discussed in Section 15.5.2. and Chapter 13. 15.4 Financing needs 15.4.1  Definitions of financing needs  Financing needs are discussed in various contexts, only one being international climate politics and finance. Also, financing needs are used as an indicator for required system changes (when compared to current flows and asset bases) and an indicator for near- to long-term investment opportunities from the perspective of investors and corporates. Investment needs are widely used as an indicator focusing on initial investments required to realise new infrastructure. It compares relatively well with private sector flows  dominated  by  return-generating  investments  but  lacks  comparability  and  explanatory  power regarding  the  needs  in  the  context  of  international  climate  cooperation  where  considerations  on economic costs play a more substantial role. Chapter 12 elaborates on global economic cost estimates for  various  technologies.  This  indicator  includes  both  costs  and  benefits  of  options,  of  which investment-related costs make up only one component. . Both analyses offer complementary insights. There are financing needs not directly related to the realisation of physical infrastructure and which are not  covered  in  both,  investment  and  cost estimates.  For  instance, the  need  for  building institutional capacity facilitating to achieve social and economic goals underpinning knowledge, skills, notional and international cooperation might not be significant, but an enabling environment for future investments would not be established without satisfying it. Moreover, comprehending financial needs for addressing economic losses due to climate change can hardly be measured in terms of the indicators introduced before. Understanding the magnitude of the challenge to scale-up finance in sectors and regions requires a more comprehensive  (and  qualitative)  assessment  of  the  needs.  For  finance  to  become  an  enabler  of  the transition, domestic and international public interventions can be needed to ensure enough supply of finance across sectors, regions and stakeholders. The location of financing needs and vicinity to capital matter given home bias (Fuchs et al. 2017; OECD 2017a; Ito and McCauley 2019) (prioritizing own country or regions), transaction costs and risk considerations (see also 15.2). Most of the finance is mobilised domestically but the depth of capital markets is substantially greater in developed countries, increasing the challenges to mobilise substantial volumes of additional funding for many developing countries. The same applies to various stakeholders with limited connections into the financial sector. In  addition,  governments’  enabling  financial  market  frameworks,  guidelines  and  supportive infrastructure  is  crucial  for  inclusive  finance  for  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid  (BoP),  especially disadvantaged and economically marginalised segments of society. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-28  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 The attractiveness of a sector and region for capital markets depend on several factors. Some essential elements  are  the  duration  of  loan  and  profile  as  long  term  loans  and  heavily  heterogeneous  returns represent challenges in financing mitigation technologies and policies. After the financial crisis and restricted access to long-term debt, capital intensity of technologies and resulting long payback periods of investment opportunities for mitigation technologies have been a crucial challenge  (Bertoldi et al. 2021). Also, implicit discount rates applied during the investment decision process vary depending on the  payback  profile,  with  research  mainly  covering  the  difference  between  the  financing  of  assets generating revenues versus costs (Jaffe et al. 2004; Schleich et al. 2016). In addition, a low correlation between  the  climate  projects  and  dominating  asset  classes  might  provide  an  opportunity  in  climate action  by  satisfying  the  appetite  of  institutional  investors,  which  tend  to  manage  portfolios  with consideration  of  the  Markowitz  modern  portfolio  theory  (optimizing  return  and  risk  of  a  portfolio through diversification) (Marinoni et al. 2011). Transaction cost is a significant barrier to the diffusion and commercialization of low-carbon technologies and business models and adaptation action. High transaction  costs,  attributed  to  various  factors,  such  as  complexity  and  limited  standardisation  of investments, limited pipelines, complex institutional and administrative procedures, create significant opportunity  costs  of  green  investments  comparing  with  other  standard  investments  (IRENA  2016; Nelson et al. 2016; Feldman et al. 2018). For example, transaction costs are commonly observed in small-scale,  dispersed  independent  renewable  energy  systems,  especially  in  rural  areas,  and  energy efficiency  projects  (Hunecke  et  al.  2019).  A  more  robust  standardisation  and  alignment  of  Power Purchase  Agreement  (PPA)  terms  with  best  practices  globally  has  led  to  a  substantially  increased interest in capital markets in developing countries (WBCSD 2016; Schmidt et al. 2019; World Bank 2021).  Notably,  Power  Purchase  Agreement  (PPA)  significantly  increases  the  probability  of  more balanced investment and development outcomes and ultimately more  sustainable independent power projects in developing countries. Therefore, lowering transaction costs would be essential for creating investor appetite. The role of intermediaries bundling demand for financing has been demonstrated to reduce transaction costs and to reach investors’ critical size. In addition, new innovative approaches, such  as  fintech  and  blockchain  (see  Section  15.6.8),  have  been  discussed  for  providing  new opportunities in the energy sector. Economic viability of investments – ideally not relying on the pricing of positive externalities – has been a critical driver of momentum in the past. The falling technology costs and the competitiveness of renewable technologies, especially solar PV and wind, have accelerated the deployment of renewable technologies over the past years. renewable energy technologies now often competitive, even become the cheapest, in many countries, even without financial support, (FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2015, 2016,  2017,  2018,  2019;  IEA  2020c;  IRENA  2020a)  and  without  pricing  of  the  avoided  carbon emissions. In contrast, the dependency on regulatory interventions and public financial support to create financial viability has provided a source of volatile investor appetite. The annual volume of renewable investment by country is often volatile reflecting ending and new regulations and policies (IEA 2019a).  For example, the recent Chinese policy direction towards tougher access to and a substantial cut in FiT in 2018 led to a significant drop in renewable investment and new capacity addition in China (FS-UNEP Centre  and  BNEF  2019;  Hove  2020).  However,  the  significant  bouncing  back  of  newly  installed capacity (72 GW wind power and 47 GW solar power in 2020) shows the strong development of zero carbon  power  generation  driven  by  lower  cost  and  policies  to  support  them  by  energy  revolution strategies in China. Investors had proven to be willing to work with transparent support mechanisms, such as with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which stimulated emission reductions and allowed industrialised countries to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries to meet their emission targets (Michaelowa et al. 2019). However, the collapse of carbon markets and prices, especially of the EU ETS, led to the continuous decline of Certified Emission Reductions (CER) issuances from CDM in the past years (World Bank Group 2020). Also, the dependency on regulatory intervention to ensure fair market access only has proven to burden investor appetite.

For  instance,  energy-system  developments  require  effective  and  credible commitments and action by policy-maker to ensure an efficient capital allocation aligned with climate targets (Bertram et al. 2021).  There are a lot of discussion about the regulated ownership of the private sector (European Commission 2017)  and  the  restructuring  of  electricity  market  contributed  to  low  level  of  investment  in  baseline electricity  capacity  and  in  investment  research  and  innovation.  This  changes  create  uncertainty  of investment, and barriers to market entry and exit also potentially limit the competition in the market and restrict the entrance of new investment (Finon 2006; Joskow 2007; Grubb and Newbery 2018). This is also the case in developing countries (Foster and Rana 2020). The positive development in the energy sector has benefitted from the evident stand-alone character of renewable energy generation projects. First movers realised these projects with investors and developers acting  from  conviction  (Steffen  et  al.  2018).  Such  action  is  not  possible  to  this  extent  in  energy efficiency with related investment rather representing an add-on component and consequently requiring the  support  of  decision-makers  used  to  business-as-usual  projects.  Despite  the  benefits  that improvement  of  energy  efficiency  has  in  contributing  to  curbing  energy  consumption,  mitigating greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  providing  multiple  co-benefits  (IEA  2014a),  investment  in  energy efficiency is at a low priority for firms, and the financial environment is not favourable due to lacking awareness  of  energy  efficiency  by  financial  institutions,  existing  administrative  barriers,  lack  of expertise to develop projects, asymmetric information, and split incentives (UNEP DTU 2017; Cattaneo 2019).  While  Energy  Service  Companies  (ESCO)  business  models  are  expected  to  facilitate  the investment in energy efficiency by sharing a portion of financial risk and providing expertise, there has been limited progress made with ESCO business models, and only slightly over 20% of projects used financing through ESCOs (UNEP DTU 2017).  The investment needs and existing challenges differ by sector. Each sector has different characteristics along the arguments listed above making the supply of finance by commercial investors an enabling factor  or  barrier.  In  the  transport  sector,  transformation  towards  green  mobility  would  provide significant  co-benefits  for  human  health  by reducing  transport-related  air  pollution,  so  the  transport sector  cannot  achieve  such  transformation  in  isolation  with  other  sectors.  However,  a  considerable involvement of the public sector in many transportation infrastructure projects is given, and the absence of a standard solution increases transaction costs (including bidding package, estimating, drawing up a contract, administering the contract, corruption, and so on). Financial constraints, including access to adequate  finance,  pose  a  significant  challenge  in  the  agriculture  sector,  especially  for  SMEs  and smallholder farmers. The distortion created by government failure and a lack of effective policies create barriers to financing for agriculture. The inability to manage the impact of the agriculture-related risks, such  as  seasonality, increases  uncertainty  in  financial  management.  Moreover,  inadequate infrastructure, such as electricity and telecommunication, makes it difficult for financial institutions to reach  agricultural  SMEs  and  farmers  and  increases  transaction  costs  (World  Bank  2016).  Low economies of scale, low bargaining power, poor connectivity to markets, and information asymmetry also lead to higher transaction cost (Pingali et al. 2019). In the industrial manufacturing and residential sector, gaining energy efficiency remains one of the critical challenges. Investment in achieving energy efficiency encounters some challenges when it may not necessarily generate direct or indirect benefits, such as increase in production capacity or productivity and improvement in product quality. Also, early-stage,  high  upfront  cost  and  future,  stable  revenue  stream  structure  suggest  the  needs  for  a  better enabling  environment,  such  as  a  robust  financial  market,  awareness  of  financial  institutions,  and regulatory frameworks (e.g., stringent building codes, incentives for ESCOs) (IEA 2014a; Barnsley et al. 2015).

The differences relate to the scope of the assessments  regarding sectors, regions and periods, top-down  versus  bottom-up  approaches,  and  methodological  issues  around  boundaries  of  climate-related  investment  needs,  particularly  full  vs  incremental  costs  and  the  exclusion  or  inclusion  of consumer-level investments. Information on investment needs and financing options in NDCs mirror this challenge and is heavily heterogeneous (Zhang and Pan 2016).  In particular, for global approaches, modelling assumptions are often heavily standardised, focusing on technology  costs.  Only  limited  global  analysis  is  available  on  incremental  costs  and  investments, reflecting  the  reality  of  developing  countries,  also  considering  the  interplay  with  significant infrastructure finance gaps, and can hardly serve as a robust basis for negotiations about international public climate finance.  The focus on investment irrespective of uncertainty as well as other qualitative aspects of needs does not allow for a straightforward analysis of the need for public finance to leverage private sector financing and of the country heterogeneity in terms of investment risks and access to capital (Clark et al. 2018). One source of uncertainty about the investment estimates for the power sector is the evolution of the levelized cost of technical options in the future for example the continuation of the observed declining trend  of  renewable  energy  (IRENA  2020b)  which  has  been  underestimated  in  many  modelling exercises.  The  learning  by  doing  processes  and  economies  of  scale  might  be  at  least  partially outweighted, in all countries and more specifically in SIDS and other developing countries because of different risk factors, scales of installations, accessibility, and others (Lucas et al. 2015; van der Zwaan et al. 2018). These parameters, together with transaction costs/soft costs (see Section 15.5), financing costs and the level of technical competences need to be better represented in the future to represent the “climate investment trap” in many developing countries (IDB 2019). This “climate investment trap”, as flagged by (Ameli et al. 2021b) is created by existing and expected physical effects of climate change, higher  financing  costs  and  resulting  lower  investment  levels  in  developing  countries.  Applying significantly standardised assumptions can consequently not provide robust insights for specific country groups.  This will require progress in the spatiotemporal granularity of the models (Collins et al. 2016).  Another  source  of  uncertainty  about  the  financing  needs  is  the  interplays  between  a)  the  baseline economic growth rates, b) the link between economic growth and energy demand, including rebound effects of energy efficiency gains  c) the evolution of microeconomic parameters such as fossil fuel prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates d) the level of integration between climate policies and sectoral policies and their efficacy and e) the impact of climate policies on growth and the capacity of fiscal and financial policies to offset their adverse effect (see (IPCC 2018) and AR5 (IPCC 2014, 2018)). Integrated assessment models (IAMs) try to capture some to these interplays even though they typically do not capture the financial constraints and the structural causes of the infrastructure investment gap. Many of them rely on growth models with  full exploitation of the means of production (labour and capital). They nevertheless provide useful indications of the orders of magnitude at play over the long run, and the determinants of their uncertainty. Global yearly average low-carbon investment needs until 2030 for electricity, transportation, AFOLU and energy efficiency measures incl. industry and buildings are estimated between 3% and 6% of the world’s GDP according to the analysis in section 15.5. The incremental costs of low carbon options are less than that and their funding could be achieved without reducing global consumption by reallocating 1.4% to 3.9% of global savings, 2.4% on average (see Box 4.8 of (IPCC 2018)) currently flow towards real estate, land and liquid financial vehicles. For the short Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-31  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII term decisions, the major information they give is the uncertainty range because this is an indicator of the risks decision-makers need.  While the IAMs database provides good transparency with regard to technology costs for electricity generation, assumptions driving in particular investments in energy efficiency are rarely made available in both, IAM based assessments but also other studies. Taking into account the much broader range of tested and untested technologies the confidence levels, in particular for 2050 estimates, remains low but can  provide  an  initial  indication.  Also,  the  ranges  allow  for  a  rough  indication  on  possible  “green” investment volumes and respective asset allocation for financial sector stakeholders. Using global scenarios assessed in Chapter 3 for assessing investment requirements Tables 15.2 and 15.3 present the analysis of investment requirements in global mitigation pathways assessed in Chapter 3 for key energy sub-sectors for scenarios likely to limit warming to 2°C or lower. These pathways explore the energy, land-use, and climate system interactions and thus help identify required energy sector transformations to reach specific long-term climate targets. However, reporting of investment needs outside the energy sector was scarce, reducing the explanatory power of total in the  context  of  overall  investment  needs  (Bertram  et  al.  2021)(Ekholm  et  al.  2013;  McCollum  et  al. 2018);  and  Box  4.8  in  (IPCC  2018)).  The  modelling  of  these  scenarios  is  done  with  a  variation  of scenario assumptions along different dimensions (inter alia policy, socio-economic development and technology availability), as well as with different modelling tools which represent different assumptions about the structural functioning of the energy-economy-land-use system (see “Annex III: Scenarios and modelling methods” for details). Tables 15.2 and 15.3 focus on the near-term (2023–2032) investment requirements in the energy sector and how this differs depending on temperature category (Figure 3.36 and 3.37 in Chapter 3) presents the data for the medium-term (2023-2052)). The results highlight both requirements  for  increased  investments  and  a  shift  from  fossil  towards  renewable  technologies  and efficiency  for  more  ambitious  temperature  categories.  The  substantial  ranges  within  each  category reflect multiple pathways, differentiated by socio-economic assumptions, technology etc. It is necessary to  open  up  these  extra  dimensions  and  contrast  them  with  national  and  sub-regional  analysis  to understand how investment requirements depend on particular circumstances and assumptions within a country  for  a  specific  technology.  Limiting  peak  temperature  to  levels  of  1.5°C–2°C  requires  rapid decarbonization of the global energy systems, with the fastest relative emission reductions occurring in the power generation sector (Hirth and Steckel 2016; Luderer et al. 2018).

In  the  scenarios  limiting  warming  to  below  1.5°C,  investments  into  non-biomass renewables (especially solar and wind, but also including hydro, geothermal, and others not shown in Table 15.2) increase to over 1 trillion USD yr-1 in 2030, increasing by more than factor 3 over the values of around 250–300 billion USD yr-1 that has been relatively stable over the last decade (IEA 2019a). Overall,  electricity  generation  investments  increase  considerably,  reflecting  the  higher  relevance  of capital  expenditures  in  decarbonised  electricity  systems.  While  decreasing  technology  costs  have substantially reduced the challenge of high capital intensity, still remaining relative disadvantages in terms  of  capital  intensity  of  low-carbon  power  technologies  can  especially  create  obstacles  for  fast decarbonization  in  countries  with  high  interest  rates,  which  decrease  the  competitiveness  of  those technologies (Iyer et al. 2015; Hirth and Steckel 2016; Steckel and Jakob 2018; Schmidt et al. 2019). CCS as well as nuclear will not drive investment needs until 2030, given considerably longer lead-times for these technologies, and the lack of a significant project pipeline currently.

This  illustrates  a  vital opportunity to ensure the build-up of sustainable energy infrastructures in these regions and constitutes a risk of additional carbon lock-in if investments into fossil infrastructures, especially coal-fired power plants and uncontrolled urban expansion, continue.  Investment needs in electrification derived from IAMs do not include systematically investments in end-use equipment and distribution (See Box 4.8 in IPCC 1.5°C (IPCC 2018)). Model-based estimates of investment needs don't have the regional granularity to single out LDCs, as model regions typically are defined based on geographic proximity and therefore aggregate LDCs and other countries. With the average electricity consumption per capita in Africa increasing to 0.68-0.87 (1.43-2.92) MWh in 2030 (2050) yr-1 and remaining at the very low end of the global range [0.46 in Africa compared to the upper end of 12.02 in North America, MWh per capita and year in 2020], the targeted full electrification until 2030 appears unrealistic across all scenarios. SEforAll and IEA estimate assume investment needs to decentralised  end-user  electrification  to  come  in  around  40  billion  USD  on  average  until  2030 (SEforALL and CPI 2020; IEA 2021d).  Quantitative analysis of investment needs in energy generation based on IRENA and IEA data and comparison to AR6 scenario database output.  According to IRENA, the government plans in place today call for investing at least 95 trillion USD in energy  systems  over  the  coming  three  decades  (2016–2050)  (IRENA  2020c).  Redirecting  and increasing investments to ensure a climate-safe future (Transforming Energy Scenario) would require reaching on average around 1 USD trillion yr-1 (average until 2030) for electricity generation as well as grids  and  storage,  increasing  to  above  2  USD  trillion  yr-1  (average  until  2030)  in  the  1.5  scenario (IRENA  2021).  IEA’s  respective  SDS  and  NZE  scenarios  come  in  at  average  annual  investments between  1.1  USD  trillion  yr-1  and  1.6  USD  trillion  yr-1  (average  until  2030)  (IEA  2021b).  These additional data points for the C1 and C3 category underpin the range presented in the IAM database for needs until 2032 despite the slightly varying periods.  In contrast to the IAMs, IRENA and IEA assessments do not allow for an analysis of mitigation-driven investment  needs  in  transmission  and  distribution  which  likely  results  in  an  overestimation  of  the mitigation driven investment needs in their analysis.  It is worth highlighting that driven by technology cost assumptions IRENA forecasts falling average annual investments needs for energy, but also energy efficiency, for the period 2030-2050 compared to 2020-2030.  In  the  1.5-S  scenario  the  total  annual  investment  needs  excluding  fossils  and  nuclear decrease from 5.0 trillion USD until 2030 yr-1 to 3.8 trillion USD yr-1 for 2030-2050 (IRENA 2021).In IAM  scenarios  of  Category  C1,  Electricity  supply  investments  (incl.  generation,  T&amp;D,  and  storge) remain flat at 2.2 trillion USD yr-1 through the coming three decades in absolute terms. Given rising GDP, the complementary methods and sources thus consistently point to a peak in electricity supply investments as a percentage of GDP in mitigation scenarios in the coming decade. This reflects the fact that the coming decade requires low-carbon power generation investments to both cover the demand increase  and  (partly  premature)  replacement  of  fossil  generation  capacities,  both  concentrated  in Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-34  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 emerging and developing countries. Relative investment numbers for electricity measured against GDP then decrease towards 2050, as they only need to cover natural replacement and increasing demands (which  due  to  electrification  will also  pick up in  developed  countries),  and  due  to further  declining technology costs. Investments for low-carbon fuel supply like hydrogen and synthetic fuels, and for direct electrification equipment (heat pumps, electric vehicles, etc.) scale up from much lower levels and  will  likely  continue  to  grow  as  a  share  of  GDP  until  mid-century,  though  uncertainties  and accounting is still much more uncertain. (Bertram et al. 2021). Quantitative analysis of investment needs in other sectors. As described above investment needs in non-energy sectors tend to be ignored in many integrated assessment models with studies for individual countries or regions providing a more fragmented picture only. However, the quality of estimates is likely not to be less robust given the drawbacks of integrated assessment models. Energy  efficiency  Estimates  on  energy  investment  needs  vary  significantly  with  a  low  level  of transparency with regard to underlying technology cost assumptions burdening the confidence levels.  IRENA only selectively reports financing needs for EE in buildings and industry as separate categories. For the 1.5-S average yr-1 needs until 2050 come in at 963 billion USD for buildings, 102 billion USD for heat pumps, and 354 billion USD for industry. Applying the relative share of these categories on higher  total  needs  until  2030,  around  1.8  trillion  USD  yr-1  in  buildings  and  1.7  trillion  USD  yr-1  in industry are needed in the 1.5-S and TES scenario. For the TES total EE investment needs until 2030 are stated at 29 trillion USD translating into an yearly average of around 1.8 trillion USD yr-1. IEA estimates come in at a much lower level at 0.6 and 0.8 billion USD yr-1 on average between 2026-2030 for their SDS and NZE scenarios. Transportation For the transportation sector, OECD has presented the most comprehensive assessment of financing needs in the AR6 database based on IEA data with the annual average coming in at 2.7 trillion USD in the 2°C (66%) scenario between 2015 and 2035. The assessment comprises road, rail and airports/ports infrastructure with only rail infrastructure being considered in our analysis amounting to 0.4 trillion USD on average until 2030.  On a regional level, (Oxford Economics 2017) shows, that annual infrastructure investments between 2016 and 2040  vary  widely.  For  all  available  countries (n=50)  estimates  counts  close  to  0.4 trillion USD, including 0.2 trillion USD for China. Based on available data for 9 African countries, investments in rail infrastructure range from 0.1 billion USD in Senegal to 1.6 billion USD in Nigeria. (Osama et al. 2021) highlights a 4.7 billion USD financing gap for African countries in the transport sector. In Latin America the report identifies Brazil as frontrunner of required rail investments with 8.3 billion USD, followed by Peru with 2.3 billion USD. Totally, developed countries mounting up to 117 billion USD yr-1 (n=14, mean=8.35bn USD) for rail infrastructure funding needs, succeeded by developing countries (excl. LDCs) with 26 billion USD yr-1 (n=28, mean=0.93bn USD, excluding China).  Fisch-Romito and Guivarch (2019) show, by endogenizing the impact of urban infrastructure policies on mobility needs and modal choices that transportation investment needs globally might be lower in low-carbon pathways compared with baselines, with lower investments in road and air infrastructure. This does mean that higher investments are not needed over the following two decades; this means, this is confirmed by (Rozenberg and Fay 2019) that strong policy integration between urban, transportation and energy policies reduce the total investment gap..   IRENA  as  well  as  IEA  have  presented  estimates  for  energy  efficiency  investments  in  the  transport sector. For the 1.5-S scenario, IRENA indicates average investment needs of 0.2 trillion USD yr-1 for electric vehicle infrastructure, 0.2 trillion USD yr-1 for transport energy efficiency and 0.3 trillion USD yr-1 for EV batteries (IRENA 2020d) (average until 2030). IEA indicates a total of around 0.6 and 0.8 trillion USD yr-1 for transport energy efficiency in the SDS and IEA scenario for the 2026-2030 period (IEA  2021c).

AFOLU  The  Food  and  Land  use  Coalition  estimates  additional  investment  needs  for  ten  critical transitions for the global food and land use systems to achieve the LTGG and SDGs. Additional annual investment needs until 2030 add up to 300-350 billion USD. Considering the change in global diets as well as the land-based nature-based solutions only, annual investment needs would come in between 110–135 billion USD. Chapter 7 stresses the importance of opportunity costs for AFOLU mitigation options, in particular for afforestation projects [cross-reference], and derives average yearly investment needs of around 278 billion USD yr-1 until 2030 and 431 USD billion yr-1 in the next several decades, including opportunity costs. The estimate is based on an assumption of emission reductions consistent with pathways C1-C4, leading to average abatement of 9.1 GtCO2 yr-1 (median range 6.7 – 12.3 GtCO2 yr-1) from 2020-2050 and marginal costs of 100 USD per ton CO2, excluding investments in BECCS and  changes  in  food  consumption  and  food  waste  (see  Section  7.4).  The  largest  investments  are projected to occur in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, constituting 61% of total expenditure. The implied change of land use might trigger negative effects on other SDGs which need to be addressed to offer robust safeguards and labelling for investors.  However, given the strong interlinkage of the presented transitions and accumulated effects, climate change  related  investments  can  hardly  be  separated  (The  Food  and  Land  Use  Coalition  2019). (Shakhovskoy  et  al.  2019)  present  an  overview  of  financing  needs  of  small-scale  farmers  globally, however, without focusing on the required climate related investments. According to their assessment 270 million smallholder farmers in South/South-East Asia, sub-Sahara Africa and Latin America face approximately  240  billion USD  of  financing  needs, thereof  100  billion  USD  short-term  agricultural needs,  88  billion  USD  long-term  agricultural  needs  and  50  billion  USD  non-agricultural  needs  ( Shakhovskoy et al.  2019). These numbers can only provide “an indication of the magnitude of the climate investments required in small-scale agriculture” (CPI 2020).

Upper end of range incl. opportunity costs as these likely increase costs of investment of land. Adaptation financing needs.  Financing  needs  for  adaptation  are  even  more  difficult  to  define  than  those  of  mitigation  because mobilizing  specific  adaptation  investments  is  only  part  of  the  challenge  since  ultimately  improving societies'  adaptive  capacities  depends  on  the  SDGs'  fulfilment  (Hallegatte  et  al.  2016).  Bridging  the investment gap on irrigation, water supply, healthcare, energy access, and quality buildings is an essential enabling condition for adapting to climate change. The scenario analysis conducted by (Rozenberg and Fay 2019) show that fulfilling the SDGs to improve the adaptive capacity of low and middle income countries  would  require  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  irrigation  and  flood  protection  that would account for about 0.5% of developing countries GDP in a baseline scenario to 1,85% and 1% with a strong and anticipatory policy integration (USD 664 billion and 351 billion on average by 2030). Most  studies  choose  to assess  public  sector  projects ignoring  household level investments as  well as private  sector  adaptation  (UNEP  2018;  Buchner  et  al.  2019).  UNEP  2016  Adaptation  Gap  Report estimates  adaptation  financing  needs  amounting  to  140–300  billion  USD  yr-1  by  2030  and  280–500 billion USD yr-1 by 2050 (UNEP 2016, 2018, 2021). Over 100 countries included adaptation components in their intended NDCs (INDCs) and approximately 25% of these referenced national adaptation plans (NAPs) (GIZ 2017a) but estimates of the financing required for NAP processes is not available (NAP Global  Network  2017).  These  NAPs,  as  formally  agreed  under  the  UNFCCC  in  2010  are  iterative, continuous processes that have multiple stages with a developmental phase that requires country specific financing  of  primarily  packages  domestic  sources,  grants,  bond  issuance  or  debt  conversion  (NDC Partnership 2020). At the same time, multilateral climate funds such as the Green Climate Fund and the GEF/LDCF offer  ‘readiness and preparatory support’ and implementation for the NAPs and adaptation planning process (GCF 2020a; GEF 2021a,b). There has been no significant updating of adaptation cost estimates  since  (UNEP  2016,  2018).  The  Global  Commission  on  Adaptation  makes  the  case  that investing USD 1.8 trillion in early warning system, climate resilient infrastructure, global mangrove and resilient water resources would generate  about USD1.7 trillion in benefits due to avoided cost  and non-monetary and social resources ( Verkooijen 2019; UNEP 2021). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-37  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII There is increasing recognition of rising adaptation challenges and associated costs within and across Developed  countries.  Undoubtedly  many  developed  countries  are  spending  more  on  wide  range  of adaptation issues both as preventive measures and building resilience (greening infrastructure, climate proofing  major  projects  and  managing  climate  related  risks)  against  the  impacts  of  climate  change extreme  weather  events  (USGCRP  2018).  Developed  countries  climate  change  adaptation  spending covers areas such as federal insurance programmes, federal, state and local property and infrastructure, supply chains, water systems. 15.5 Considerations on financing gaps and drivers 15.5.1  Definitions The analysis of financing gaps in climate action, which is used to measure implementation action and mitigation  impact  (FS-UNEP  Centre and  BNEF 2019)  cannot  be  carried  out  as  a  pure  demand-side challenge, in isolation from the analysis of barriers to deploy funds  (e.g. (Ramlee and Berma 2013)) and to take investment initiatives. These barriers are friction that prevents socially optimal investments from being commercially attractive’ (Druce et al. 2016). They are at the root of the “microeconomic paradox”  of  a  deficit  of  infrastructure  investments  despite  a  real  return  between  4%  and  8% (Bhattacharya et al., 2016), of the low share of carbon saving potentials tapped by dedicated policies such as energy renovation programmes (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018), and, more generally of a demand for climate finance lower than the volume of economically viable projects(de Gouvello and Zelenko 2010; Timilsina et al. 2010).. A few exercises tried and assess the consequences of the perpetuation of these drivers on the magnitude of  the financing  gap.  They  suggest, comparing  the  evolution of the  infrastructure  investment trends (beyond energy) by comparison with what they should be in an optimal scenario, a cumulative deficit between 15.9% in 2035 (Oxford Economics 2017) and 32% (Arezki et al. 2016). The volume of this gap  is  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  than  the  incremental  infrastructure  investments  (energy  and beyond) for meeting a 1.5°C target, 2.4 % of the world GDP on average, (Box 4.8, IPCC 1.5°C 2018 (IPCC 2018)) calculated by exercises assuming no pre-existing investment gap. This figure is consistent with the 1.5% to 1.8% assessed by (European Commission 2020) for Europe and the 2% of the (IMF 2021d) for the G20 which do not encompass many developing countries of which economic take-off is today fossil fuels dependent. For low and middle income economies, (Rozenberg and Fay 2019) results suggest to increase the infrastructure investments by 2.5 to 6 percentage points of the GDP to cover both the reduction of the structural investment gap and the specific additional costs for bridging it with low carbon and climate resilient options. These assessments indicate the challenge at stake but do not exist at very disaggregated sectoral and regional levels for sectors other than energy.  The below quantitative analysis does not differentiate between financing gaps driven by barriers within or outside the financial sector given that the IAM models as well as most other studies used do not incorporate  actual risk ranges depending on policy strength and coherence and institutional capacity, low-carbon-policy-risks,  lack  of  long-term  capital,  cross-border  currency  fluctuation,  and  pre-investment costs and barriers within the financial sector that are discourage private sector funding. They comprise  short-termism  (e.g.  (UNEP  Inquiry  2016b)),  high  perceived  risks  for  mitigation  relevant technologies and/or regions (information gap through incomplete/ asymmetric information, e.g. (Clark et al. 2018)), lack of carbon pricing effects (e.g. (Best and Burke 2018)), home bias (results in limited balancing for regional mismatches between current capital and needs distribution, e.g. (Boissinot et al. 2016)), and perceived high opportunity and transaction costs (results from limited visibility of future pipelines and policy interventions; SME financing tickets and the missing middle, e.g. (Grubler et al. 2016)).

The mix and dominance of individual barriers might vary significantly across sectors and regions and is analysed below The  interpretation  of  the  quantitative  analysis  thus  needs  to  be  performed,  taking  into  account  the qualitative needs assessment in Section 15.4.1 and the evolution of parameters that determine the risk-weighted  relative  attractiveness  low  carbon  and  climate  resilient  investments  compared  to  other investment  opportunities.  With  some  institutions  having  announced  climate  finance  commitments and/or targets (see also Box 15.4 Measuring progress towards the 100 billion USD yr-1 by 2020 goal: issues of method), the actual asset allocation of commercial financial sector players including sectoral and regional focus will respond to tangible and financially viable investment opportunities available in the  short-term.  Robust long-term  pathways to  create such  conditions for  a significant  private  sector involvement  do  rarely  exist  and  expectations  on  private  sector  involvement  in  some  critical sectors/regions might be too high (Clark et al. 2018).  15.5.2  Identified financing gaps for sector and regions The following section compares current climate finance flows as reported by CPI and IEA to needs derived in section 15.4 ignoring the slight mismatch in time horizons. The analysis ignores interlinked gaps in particular infrastructure investment gaps and other SDG-related investment gaps, which need to be addressed in parallel to reach the LTGG but also at least partially to facilitate green investments.  Total investments in mitigation need to increase by around 3 and 6 times with significant gaps existing across sectors and regions (high confidence). The findings on still significant gaps and limited progress over the  past few  years to some  extent  seem to  contradict the massive increase in  commitments  by financial institutions. As discussed in section 15.6 the investment gap is not due to global scarcity of funds. However, these investment gaps have any little explanatory power in terms of the magnitude of the challenge to mobilise funding. In addition to measurement challenges from different definitions and data gap, sectors and regions offer highly divergent financial risk-return profiles and economic costs as well  as  standardization,  scalability  and  replicability  of  investment  opportunities  as  basis  for  private sector investment appetite. Moreover, soft costs and institutional capacity for enabling environment that can be prerequisite for addressing financing gap are ignored when focusing on investment cost needs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-39  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS    Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Figure 15.4 Breakdown of average investment flows and needs until 2030 Flows: Yearly CPI data for the Agriculture and Forest, Electricity, Energy Efficiency, and Transport.

Sectoral considerations. The renewable energy sector attracted the highest level of funding in absolute and relative terms with business models in generation being proven and rapidly falling technology costs driving the competitiveness of solar photovoltaic and on-shore wind even without taking account the mitigation  component  (FS-UNEP  Centre and  BNEF 2019;  IRENA  2020a).  This  investment  activity comes in line with the first generation of NDCs and their heavy focus on mitigation opportunities in the renewable energy sector (Pauw et al. 2016; Schletz et al. 2017). Still, the investment gap tends to remain stable with flows over the past years not showing an upward trend. Comparing  annual  average  total  investments  in  global  fuel  supply  and  the  power  sector  of approximately  1.61  trillion  USD  yr-1  in  2019  (IEA  2020a)  to  the  investment  in  the  Stated  Policies Scenario  (approximately  1.84  trillion  USD  yr-1)  and  the  Sustainable  Development  Scenario (approximately  1.91  trillion  USD  yr-1)  in  2030  underlines  the  required  shift  of  existing  capital Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-40  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS   Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 investment from fossil to renewables even more than the need to increase sector allocations (Granoff et al. 2016; McCollum et al. 2018).  Ensuring access to the heavily regulated electricity markets is a key driver for an accelerated private sector engagement (IFC 2016; FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2018; REN21 2019)  with phasing out of support schemes and regulatory uncertainty being a major driver for reduced investment volumes in various regional markets in the past years (FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020). Strategic investors and corporate investments by utilities dominate the investment activity in developed countries and countries in transition (BNEF 2019) based on the competitiveness of renewable energy sources. Reasonable auction results based on a substantial private-sector competition for investments have  also  been  achieved  in  selected  developing  countries  driven  by  rather  standardised  contract structures and the increased availability of risk mitigation instruments addressing political/regulatory risks  and  home  bias  constraints  (FS-UNEP  Centre  and  BNEF  2019;  IRENA  2020a).  DFI  climate portfolios tend to be driven by concessional loans for renewable energy generation assets with equity often being provided by (semi-) commercial investors (see Section 15.3) which will have to change to accelerate renewable energy investment activity.  Given  the  wide  range  of  estimates  on  current  investment  flows  into  energy  efficiency,  substantial uncertainty exists with regard to the magnitude of the investment gaps. While CPI publishes investment levels of 44 billion in 2019 and 26 billion in 2020) for energy efficiency, counting majorly international flows, IEA results come in at a much higher level of more than annually 250bn USD between 2017 and 2020 (IEA 2021c) and (IRENA 2020c) estimates energy efficiency investments in buildings between 2017-2019 at an average of 139 bn USD yr-1.  Public sector investments in the transport sector have increased significantly in the past years reflecting the  increased  interest  of  capital  markets  in  renewable  energy  and  the  efficient  and  corresponding reallocation  of  public  funding.  Provision  of  funding  by  capital  markets  for  public  transport infrastructure among others heavily depend on suitable financing vehicles and increased funding for development of projects with a low level of standardization (OECD, 2015a).   Both IRENA and IEA include only incremental costs of EVs in their estimates on needs while CPI, when measuring actual flows, includes those at full costs. Total private flows for EVs included in CPI numbers amount to 41bn USD in 2018 (Buchner et al. 2019), representing more than 80% of private sector  finance  into  the  transport  sector  around  one  third  of  total,  public  and  private,  funding  to  the transport sector in 2018. This likely results in an underestimation of the financing gap – in addition to the  fact  that  estimates  for  investment  needs  for  rail  infrastructure  are  only  available  for  selected countries.  Current funding of land-based mitigation options is less than 1 billion USD yr-1 representing only 2.5% of climate mitigation funding, significantly below the potential proportional contribution (Buchner et al.  2019).  A  stronger  focus  on  deforestation-free  value  chain,  including  a  stronger  reflection  in taxonomies and financial sector investment decision processes are necessary to ensure an alignment of financial flows with the LTGG. Taking into account the specifics of land-based mitigation (in particular long investment horizons, strong dependency on the monetization of mitigation effects, strong public sector involvement) a significant scale-up of commercial funding to the sector can hardly be expected in absence of strong climate policies (Clark et al. 2018). Agriculture is likely to develop more potential to mobilise private finance than the forest sector given its strong linkage to food security and hunger and shorter payback periods. The significant gap in land-based mitigation finance also indicates the crucial lack of finance to the bottom of the pyramid. Agricultural support is an important source of distortions to agricultural incentives in both rich and poor countries (Mamun et al. 2019) ranging from largest component of the support, market price supports, increased  gross  revenue  to  farmers  as  a  result  of  higher  prices  due  to  market  barriers  created  by Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-41  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 government policies, to production payments and other support including input subsidy (e.g. fertilizer subsidy)  (Searchinger et al. 2020). 600 billion USD of annual governmental support for agriculture in the OECD database contributes only modestly to the related objectives of boosting crop yields and just transition (Searchinger et al. 2020). A review of (NDCs of 40 developing countries which submitted a NDC to the UNFCCC Interim NDC Registry by April 2017, and include within their NDC efforts to REDD+ via support from the UN-REDD Programme and/or World Bank Forest Carbon Partnership Facility) indicates that none of the countries reviewed mention fiscal policy reform of existing finance flows  to  agricultural  commodity  production  or  other  publicly  supported  programmes  that  affect  the direct and underlying drivers of land use conversion (Kissinger et al. 2019).  Analysis by region and type of economy. The analysis of gaps by type of economy illustrates the challenge for developing countries. Estimated mitigation financing needs as percentage of current GDP (USD2015) comes in at around 2-4% for developed countries, and around 5-10% for developing countries (see Figure 15.4) (high confidence). Climate finance flows have to increase by factor 4-8 in developing countries  and  2-5  in  developed  countries.  This  disparity  is  further  exacerbated  when  considering adaptation, infrastructure and SDG related investment needs (Hourcade et al. 2021a) (high confidence). However,  differences  across  developing  countries  are  significant.  Flows  to  Eastern  Asia,  with  its average flows of 269 billion USD being dominated by China (more than 95% of total mitigation flows to Eastern Asia), would have to increase by a factor of 2-4, a comparable level to developed countries. Section 15.6.2 elaborates on outlooks with regard to fiscal space and ability to tap capital markets, in particular for developing countries. In particular, attention must accelerate on low-income Africa. This large  continent  currently  contributes  very  little  to  global  emissions,  but  its  rapidly  rising  energy demands and renewable energy potential versus its growing reliance on fossil fuels and ‘cheap’ biomass (especially  fuelwood  for  cooking  and  charcoal  with  impacts  on  deforestation)  amid  fast-rising urbanization makes it imperative that institutional investors and policy-makers recognise the very large 'leap-frog'  potential  for  the  renewable  energy  transition  as  well  as  risks  of  lock-in  effects  in infrastructure more general in Africa that is critical to hold the global temperatures rise to well below 2°C in the longer-term (2020–2050). Overlooking this transition opportunity, rivalling China, India, US and  Europe,  would  be  costly.  Policies  centred  around  the  accelerated  development  of  local  capital markets  for  energy  transitions  -  with  support  from  external  grants,  supra-national  guarantees  and recognition of carbon remediation assets - are crucial options here, as in other low-income countries and regional settings.  Notably, climate finance flows to African countries might have even decreased by about one fifth for mitigation technology deployment (stagnated for adaptation between 2017 and 2020), widening the finance gap in African countries in the recent years (high confidence).   Over 80% of climate finance is reported to originate and stay within borders, and even higher for private climate flows (over 90%) (Boissinot et al. 2016). There are multiple reasons for such ‘home bias’ in finance  -  national  policy  support,  differences  in  regulatory  standards,  exchange  rate,  political  and governance risks, as well as information market failures. The extensive home bias means that even if national actions are announced and intended to be implemented unilaterally and voluntarily, the ability to implement them requires access to climate finance which are constrained by the relative ability of financial and capital markets at home to provide such financing, and access to global capital markets that requires supporting institutional policies in source countries. ‘Enabling’ public policies and actions locally  (cities, states, countries  and  regions),  to  reduce  investment  risks  and  boost  domestic  climate capital markets  financing, and to enlarge the  pool  of external climate financing sources  with  policy support from source capital countries thus matter at a general level. The biggest challenge in climate finance is likely to be in developing countries, even in the presence of enabling policies and quite apart from any other considerations such as equity and climate justice (Klinsky et al. 2017) or questions about the equitable allocations of future ‘climate budgets’ (Gignac and Matthews 2015). The differentiation between developed and developing countries matter most on financing. Most developed countries have already achieved very high levels of incomes, have the largest pool of capital stock and financial capital (which  can  be  more  easily  redeployed  within  these  countries  given  the  ‘home  bias’  of  financial Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-42  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 markets),  the  most  well-developed  financial  markets  and  the  highest  sovereign  credit-ratings,  in addition to starting with very high levels of per capita carbon consumption - factors that should allow the fastest adjustment to low carbon investments and transition in these countries from domestic policies alone. The financial and economic circumstances are the opposite for virtually all developing countries, even within a heterogeneity of circumstances across countries. The dilemma, however, is that the fastest rates  of  the  expected  increase  in  future  carbon  emissions  are  in  developing  countries.  The  biggest challenge of climate finance globally is thus likely to be the constraints to climate financing because of the opportunity costs and relative under-development of capital markets and financing constraints (and costs) at home in developing countries, and the relative availability or absence of adequate financing policy  support  internationally  from  developed  countries.  The  Paris  Agreement  and  commitment  by developed countries to support the climate financing needs of developing countries thus continue to matter a great deal.  Soft  costs  /  Institutional  capacity  (Osama  et  al.  2021).  Most  funding  needs  assessments  focus  on technology  costs  and  ignore  the  cascade  of  financing  needs  as  outlined  above.  International  grant funding or national budget allocations for soft costs like the creation of a regulatory environment can be prerequisite for the supply of commercial financing for the deployment of technologies. Such critical funding needs might represent a small share of overall investment needs but current (relatively small) gaps in funding of policy reforms can hinder/delay deployment of large volumes of funding in later years. The role, as well as the approximate volumes of such required timely international grant funding or  national  budget  allocations,  appear  underestimated  in  research.  The  numbers  available  for  the creation of an enabling environment for medium-sized RE projects in Uganda (GET FiT Uganda) are illustrative only and cannot be transferred as assumptions to other countries without taking into account potentially varying starting points in terms of institutional readiness, pipelines as well as the general business environment. GET FiT Uganda supported 170 MWp of medium-scale RE capacity triggering investments of 453 million USD (GET FiT Uganda 2018), international results-based incremental cost support  amounted  to  92  million  USD  and  project  preparation,  technical  assistance,  as  well  as implementation support, required 8 million USD excluding support from national agencies.  There is strong evidence of the correlation between institutional capacity of countries and international climate finance flows towards those economies (Adenle et al. 2017; Stender et al. 2019) and a strong need for robust institutional capacity to manage the transformation in a sustainable and human rights based way (Duyck et al. 2018). One example to consider unaddressed social concerns, is the ongoing call for feedback by the European Commission and its platform on sustainable finance. It  argues for a social taxonomy, that can support the identification of financing opportunities of economic activities contributing to social objectives (European Commission 2021b). SEforAll has highlighted the issue of investments not going to the countries with the greatest need, also partly driven by institutional capacity levels (SEforALL and CPI 2020). Also, most of the developing countries NDCs are conditional upon international  support  for capacity  building  (Pauw  et al.  2020).  The  Climate  Technology  Centre  and Network (CTCN) was created as an operational arm of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism with the mandate  to  respond  to  requests  from  developing  countries.  Initial  evaluations  of  the  mechanism underpin its importance and value for developing countries but stress long lead times and predictability of  future  international  public  funding  to  maintain  operations  as  key  challenges  (UNFCCC  2017; DANIDA 2018). While limited pipelines, limited absorptive capacities as well as restricted institutional capacity of countries being often stated as challenge for an accelerated deployment of funding (Adenle et al. 2017), the question remains on the role of international public climate finance to address this gap and whether a concrete current financing gap exists for patient institutional capacity building. While current short-term, mostly project-related capacity building often fails to meet needs but alternative, well-structured patient interventions and funding could play an important role (Saldanha 2006; Hope 2011) accepting other barriers than funding playing a role as well. One reason why international public climate  funding  is  not  sufficiently  directed  to  such  needs  might  be  the  complexity  in  measuring intangible, direct outcomes like improved institutional capacity (Clark et al. 2018).

Figure SPM.8 highlights the need for new business models facilitating parts of the behavioural change. Also, SE4All has underpinned the need for an expansion of available business models to achieve universal access (SEforALL and CPI 2020). Further research and development needs range from resource efficiency of proven  technologies  and  next  generation  technologies  but  also  new  technologies  (see  Chapter  16).  Access to early stage funding remains critical with performance in in recent years being weak (Gaddy et al. 2016). This historically weak performance of clean tech start-ups burdens the interest of investors in  the  sector  on  the  one  hand  and  discourage  experienced  executive  talent  (Wang  and  Yee  2020). Besides that, the concentration of VC markets in the US, Europe and India represents a major challenge (FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2019; Statistica 2021). With regard to commercial-scale demonstration projects, IEA estimates a need of 90 USD billion of public sector funding before 2030 having around 25 billion USD already planned by governments to 2030 (IEA 2021c).  Need parallel rather than sequential investment decisions. The needs and gaps assessment does not include upstream investment needs required to facilitate the technology deployment as foreseen in the scenarios presented above. For example, for their transforming energy scenario IRENA estimates the number of EVs to increase from around 8m units in 2019 to 269m units in 2030 (IRENA 2020c). This would require investments in battery factories amounting to approximately 207 USD billion with further investment  requirements  in  the  value  chain  (IRENA  2020d).  This  illustrates  the  extent  of  parallel investments based on goals rather than concrete regulatory interventions and/or demand and poses a problem of up-front investment risks for each industry in the chain in the absence of certainty of the presence  of  parallel  decisions  in  the  upstream  and  downstream  links  in  the  chain.  This  is  a  typical element of the ‘valley of the death’ of innovation (Scherer et al. 2000; Åhman et al. 2017). It discourages risk-taking and slows-down the learning-by-doing processes, economies of scale and increasing returns to adoption needed for lowering the costs of systemic technical change (Kahouli-Brahmi 2009; Weiss et al. 2010). Implications on risk perception, financing costs as well as investment decision making processes and ultimately on feasibility are rarely considered.  Finance for adaptation and resilience. As explained early the reduction of the infrastructure gap to increase the societies’ resilience and the implementation of the NAPs of will require more and higher levels  of  sustained  financing.  Activities  mobilized  for  adaptation  and  resilience  are  often  non marketable and their funding will continue coming from the public sector noted by (Murphy and Parry 2020) and, at the international level from grants based technical assistance or through budgetary support or basket funding for large projects/program or sector wide approaches or multilateral funding under (Non-)UNFCCC 2 are  also  anticipate  supporting  NAP  implementation  -  particularly  those  involved incremental  costs  and  co-benefits,  which  will  include  sectoral  approach  such  as  water,  energy, infrastructures, food production. According to the UNFCCC, ‘in 2015–2016, 3 per cent of international public adaptation finance flows was supplied by multilateral climate funds, while 84 per cent came from development finance institutions and 13 per cent from other government sources’ (UNFCCC 2019c). Comprehensive reporting on adaptation finance by (Murphy and Parry 2020) and (Buchner et al. 2019) argues  that  flows  of  finance  for  adaptation  action  in  developing  countries  in  2017  and  2018  were estimated to be approximately USD 30 billion; this plus an additional estimated flow of USD 12 billion for dual adaptation and mitigation actions totalled USD 42 billion accounting for 7.25% of the total estimated international public and private flows of climate finance (Buchner et al. 2019). They are far below the financing needs given in 15.4. To date, the private sector has limited involvement in NAPs FOOTNOTE2 Those under the UNFCCC such as the GCF through its 3 million USD per country readiness and preparatory support programme, the LDCF and the SCCF and the PPCR and ASAP are focused on supporting the preparatory process of the NAPs. But the Adaptation Fund will support the implementation of concrete projects up to 10 million USD per country.

However,  adaptation financing is only about 2% of the share of green bond financing raised up to June 2019 (UNFCCC 2019c)3 ,  whereas  it  is  about  10%  of  sovereign  green  bonds  raised  (UNFCCC  2019d).  (Tuhkanen 2020a),  in  a  detailed  review  of  green  bond  issuance in  the  Environmental  Finance  Data  base  2019, found  that  between  March  2010  to  April  2019,  ‘5%  of  all  green  bonds  issued  were  categorized  as adaptation and that ‘the private sector accounts for a significant proportion of adaptation-related green bond  issuances’  (p.11).  However,  citing  (GIZ  2017b;  Nicol  et  al.  2017,  2018a)  (Tuhkanen  2020b) highlights that there is scepticism about this stream of funding for adaptation due to the factors that has thus  far  limited  the  private  sector‘s  involvement  in  adaptation:  lack  of  resilience-related  revenue streams,  the  small-scale  of  some  adaptation  projects  and  the  overall  “intangibility”  of  funding adaptation projects,‘ (p.9). (Larsen et al. 2019) Financing for resilience is limited unpredictable, fragmented and focused on few projects or sectors and short term as opposed to programmatic and long-term (10–15 years) funding to build resilience (ISDR 2009, 2011; Kellett and Peters 2014; Watson et al. 2015). Market-based mechanisms are available but not equally accessible to all developing countries, particularly SIDS and LDCs and such mechanisms can undermine debt sustainability (OECD and World Bank 2016).. While resilience financing is mainly grant-funding,  concessional  loans  are  increasing  substantially  and  are  key  sources  of  financing  for disaster and resilience, particularly for upper-middle-income countries (OECD and World Bank 2016). The  combination  of  these  trends  can  contribute  to  greater  levels  of  indebtedness  among  many developing countries many of who are already at or approaching debt distress. Social protection systems can be linked with a number of the instruments already considered: reserve funds, insurance and catastrophe bonds, regional risk-sharing facilities, contingent credit, in addition to traditional  international  aid  and  disaster  response.  (Hallegatte  et  al.  2017)  recommend  combining adaptive  social  protection with financial  instruments in  a consistent  policy  package,  which includes financial instruments to deliver adequate liquidity and contingency plans for the disbursement of funds post-disaster.  Challenges  related  to  financing  residual  climate-related  losses  and  damages  are particularly high for developing countries. Financing losses and damages from extreme events requires rapid  pay-outs;  the  cost  of  financing  for  many  developing  countries  is  already  quite  high;  and  the expense of risk financing is expected to increase as disasters become more frequent, intense and more costly not only due to climate change but also due to higher levels of exposure. Addressing both extreme and slow onset climate impacts requires designing adequate financial protection systems for reaching the most vulnerable. Moreover, some fraction of losses and damages, both material and non-material, are not commonly valued in monetary terms [non-economic loss] and hence financing requirements are hard  to  estimate.  These  non-market-based  residual  impacts  include  loss  of  cultural  identity,  sacred places, human health and lives (Paul 2019; Serdeczny 2019). 15.6 Approaches to accelerate alignment of financial flows with long-term global goals Near-term actions to shift the financial system over the next decade are critically important and possible with globally coordinated efforts.

Achieving climate mitigation and adaptation objectives requires ambitious climate finance flows in the near-term, i.e. 5-10 years ahead. However, knowledge gaps in the assessment of climate-related financial risk are a key barrier to such climate finance flows. Therefore, this section discusses the main knowledge gaps that are currently being addressed in the literature and those that remain outstanding Climate-related financial risk is meant here as the potential adverse impact of climate change on the value of financial assets. A recent but remarkable development since AR5 is that climate change has been explicitly recognised by financial supervisors as a source of financial risk that matters both for financial institutions and citizens’ savings (Bolton et al. 2020). Previously, climate change was mostly regarded in the finance community only as an ethical issue. The reasons why climate change implies financial risk are not new and are discussed more in detail below. What is new is that climate enters now as a factor in the assessment of financial institutions’ risk (e.g. such as the European Central Bank or the European Banking Authority) and credit rating (see also Section 15.6.3) and, going forward, into stress-test exercises. This implies changes in incentives of the supervised financial actors, both public and private, and thus changes in the landscape of mitigation action by generating a new potential for climate finance flows. However, critical knowledge gaps remain. In particular, the underestimation of climate-related  financial  risk  by  public  and  private  financial  actors  c an   ex pl ai n  that the current allocation  of  capital among financial institutions is often inconsistent with the mitigation objectives (Rempel et al. 2020). Moreover, even a correct assessment of risk, which could provide incentives for divesting from carbon-intensive activities, does not necessarily lead to investing in the technical options needed for deep decarbonisation. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the low carbon transition require to fill in at the same time gaps about risk and gaps about investments in enabling activities in a broader sense.  impacts  especially Physical risk. On the one hand, unmitigated climate change implies an increased potential for adverse socio-economic in  more  exposed  economic  activities  and  areas  (high confidence).  Accordingly, physical risk refers to the component of financial risk associated with the adverse physical impact of hazards related to climate change (e.g., extreme weather events or sea level rise) on the financial value of  assets  such  as industrial plants  or  real  estate.  In  turn,  these losses can translate into losses on the values of financial assets issued by exposed companies (e.g., equity/bonds) and or sovereign entities as well as losses for insurance companies. The assessment of climate financial physical risks poses both challenges  in  terms  of  data,  methods  and  scenarios.  It  requires  to  cross-match  scenarios  of climate-related  hazards  at  granular  geographical  scale,  with  the  geolocation  and financial  value  of  physical assets.  The  relationship  between  the  value  of  physical  assets  (such  as plants  or  real  estate)  and  the financial value of securities issued by the owners of those assets is not straightforward.  Further, the repercussion of climate related hazards on sovereign risk should also be accounted for.  Transition risks and opportunities. On the other hand, the mitigation of climate change, by means of a transition to a low-carbon economy, requires a transformation of the energy and production system at a pace and scale that implies adverse impacts on a range of economic activities, but also opportunities for some other activities (high confidence). If these impacts are factored in by financial markets, they are  reflected  in  the  value  of  financial  assets.  Thus,  transition  risks  and  opportunities  refer  to  the component  of  financial risk (opportunities) associated with negative (positive) adjustments in assets’ values resulting directly or indirectly from the low-carbon transition. The concepts of carbon-stranded assets (see e.g.(Leaton and Sussams 2011), and orderly vs. disorderly transition (Sussams et al. 2015) emerged in the NGO community, have provided powerful metaphors Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-47  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 to  conceptualise  transition  risks  and  have  evolved  into  concepts  used  also  by  financial  supervisors (NGFS 2019)  and academics. The term carbon stranded assets refer to fossil-fuel-related assets (fuel or equipment) that become unproductive. An orderly transition is defined here as a situation in which market players are able to fully anticipate the price adjustments that could arise from the transition. In this case, there would still be losses associated with stranded assets, but it would be possible for market players to spread losses over time and plan ahead. In contrast, a disorderly transition is defined here as a situation in which a transition to a low carbon economy on a 2C° path is achieved (i.e., by about 2040), but the impact of climate policies in terms of reallocation of capital into low-carbon activities and the corresponding adjustment in prices of financial assets (e.g. bonds and equity shares) is large, sudden and not fully anticipated by market players and investors. Note the impact could be unanticipated even if the date of the introduction is known in advance by the market players. There are several reasons why such adjustments could occur. One simple argument is that the political  economy of the transition is characterised by  forces  in  different  directions,  including  opposing  interests  within  the  industry, mounting  pressure  from  social  awareness  of  unmitigated  climate  risks.  Politics  will  have  to  find  a synthesis and the outcome could remain uncertain until it suddenly unravels. Note also that, in order to be relevant for financial risk, the disorderly transition does not need to be a catastrophic scenario in terms of the fabric of markets. It also does not automatically entail systemic risk, as discussed further down. Knowledge gaps in this area are related to emerging questions, including: What are, in detail, the transmission channels of physical and transition risk? How to assess the magnitude of the exposure to these risks for financial institutions and ultimately for people’s savings?  How do transition risk and opportunities depend on the future scenarios of climate change and climate policies? How to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty around the scenarios? To what extent, an underestimation of climate-related financial risk, could feed back on the alignment of climate finance flows and hamper the low-carbon transition?  Should  climate  risk  be  explicitly  accounted  for  in  regulatory  frameworks  for financial  institutions,  such  as  Basel  III  for  banks  and  national  frameworks  for  insurance?  What  lessons  from  the  2008  financial  crisis  are  relevant  here,  regarding  moral  hazard  and  the trustworthiness  of  credit  risk  ratings?  The  attention  of  both  practitioners  and  the  scientific community to these questions has grown since the Paris Agreement. In the following we review some of the findings from the literature, but the field is relatively young and many of the questions are still open.4 Nordic  countries  (FinansNorge et al. 2013).  Damages  from  climate  change  are  expected  to escalate dramatically in Europe (Forzieri et al. 2018) and in some EU countries there is already some evidence that banks, anticipating possible losses on the their loan books, lend proportionally less to  Assessment of physical risk. There is a literature on estimates of economic losses on physical assets (see respective chapter in WGII). Here we discuss some figures and mechanisms that are relevant for the financial system.  Significant  cost  increases  have  been  observed  related  to  increases  in  frequency  and magnitude  of extreme events (see Section 15.4.2) (high confidence). At the global level, the expected ‘climate  value  at  risk’  (climate  VaR)  of  financial  assets  has  been  estimated  to  be  1.8%  along  a business-as-usual  emissions  path  (Dietz et al. 2016), with however, a concentration of risk in the tail (e.g. 99th VaR equals to 16.9%, or 24.2 trillion USD, in 2016). Climate-related impacts are estimated to increase the frequency of banking crises (up over 200% across scenarios) while rescuing insolvent banks could increase the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by a factor of 2 (Lamperti et al. 2019). Further assessments of physical risk for financial assets (Mandel 2020), accounting in particular for  the  propagation  of  losses  through  financial  networks,  estimate global yearly GDP losses at 7.1% (1.13%) in 2080, without adaptation (with adaptation), the former corresponding to a 10-fold increase with respect  to  the current yearly losses  (0.76%  of  global  GDP).  Finally,  climate  physical  risk  can FOOTNOTE 4 In  the  context,  while  belonging  to  grey  literature,  reports  from  financial  supervisors  or  non- academic stakeholders, can be of interest, for what they document in terms of changes in perception and incentives among the market players and hence of the dynamics of climate finance flows.

Insurance payouts for catastrophes have increased significantly over the last 10 years,  with  dramatic cost  spikes  in  years  with  multiple  major  catastrophes  (such  as  in  2018  with hurricanes  Harvey, Irma,  and  Maria).  This  trend  is  expected  to  continue.  The indirect costs of climate-related flooding event can be up to 50% of the total costs, the majority of which is not covered by insurance (Alnes et  al.  2018)  (see  chapter  15.6.4).  The  gap  between  total  damage  losses  and  insurance  payouts  has increased  over  the  past  10  years  (Swiss  Re  Institute  2019).  Indeed,  the  probability  of  'extreme  but plausible' scenarios will be progressively revised upwards in the ‘value at risk’ (VaR). As a result it becomes more difficult to find financial actors willing to provide insurance as it was observed for real estate  in  relation  to  flood  and  wildfires  in  California  (Ouazad  and  Kahn  2019).  This  progressive adjustment would keep the financial system safe (Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee 2020; Keenan and Bradt 2020), but transfer to taxpayers the onus of damage compensation and the funding of adaptation investments (OECD 2021c) as well as build up latent liabilities. Assessment of transition risk Carbon stranded assets. Fossil fuel reserve and resource estimates exceed in equivalent quantity of CO2 with virtual certainty the carbon budget available to reach a 1.5°C and 2°C targets (Meinshausen et al. 2009; McGlade and Ekins 2015; Millar et al. 2017) (high confidence). In relative terms, stranded assets of fossil-fuel companies amount to 82% of global coal reserves, 49% of global gas reserves and 33% of global oil reserves (McGlade and Ekins 2015). This suggests that only less than the whole quantity of fossil fuels currently valued (either currently extracted, waiting for extraction as reserves or assets on company balance sheets) can yield economic return if the carbon budget is respected. The devaluation of fossil fuel assets imply financial losses for both the public sector (see Section 15.6.8) and the private sector (Coffin and Grant 2019). Global estimates of potential stranded fossil fuel assets amount to at least  1 trillion, based on  ongoing  low-carbon  technology  trends  and  in  the absence  of climate policies  (cumulated  to  2035  with  10%  discount  rate  applied;  8  trillion  USD  without  discounting (Mercure  et  al.  2018a).  With  worldwide  climate  policies  to  achieve  the  2°C  target  with  75% likelihood,  this  could increase to over 4 trillion USD (until 2035, 10% discount rate; 12 trillion USD without discounting). Other estimates indicate 8–15 trillion USD (until 2050, 5% discount rate, (Bauer et al. 2015)) and 185 trillion USD (cumulated to year 2115 using combined social and private discount rate; ( Li nqui t i  a nd  Cogs wel l  2 01 6) . However the geographical distribution of potential stranded fossil fuel assets (also called  ‘unburnable  carbon’)  is  not  even  across  the  world  due  to  differences in  production  costs  (McGlade  and  Ekins  2015).  In  this  context,  a  delayed  deployment  of  climate funding and consequently limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreement tend to strengthen carbon and thus to increase the magnitude of stranded assets. Assets directly and indirectly exposed to transition risk. In terms of types of assets and economic activities, the focus of estimates of carbon stranded assets, tend to be on physical reserves of fossil fuel (e.g., oil fields) and sometimes financial assets of fossil-fuel companies (see (van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020)).  However, a precondition for a broader analysis of transition risks and opportunities is to  go beyond the narrative of stranded assets and to consider a classification of sectors of all the economic activities that could be affected (Monasterolo 2020). This, in turn depends on their direct or indirect role in the GHG value chain, their level of substitutability with respect to fossil fuel and their role  in the  policy  landscape.  Moreover,  such  a  classification  needs  to  be  replicable  and  comparable across portfolios and jurisdictions. One classification that meets these criteria is the Climate Policy Relevant Sectors (CPRS) (Battiston et al. 2017) which has been used in several studies by financial supervisors (EIOPA  2018;  ECB  2019;  EBA  2020;  ESMA  2020).  The  CPRS  classification  builds  on  the international classification of economic activities (ISIC) to map the most granular level (4  digits)  into a  small  set of  categories  characterised by  differing types  of  risk:  fossil-fuel  (i.e.  all activities whose Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-49  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 revenues  depends mostly and directly on fossil-fuel, including concession of  reserves and operating industrial plants for extraction and refinement); electricity (affected in terms of input but that  can  in principle  diversify  they  energy  sources);  energy  intensive  (e.g.  steel  or  cement  production  plants, automotive manufacturing plants), which are affected in terms of energy cost but not in terms of the main input);  transport  and  buildings  (affected in  terms  of  both  energy sources  and  specific  policies).  All financial  assets  (e.g.  bonds,  equity  shares,  loans)  having  as  issuers  or  counterparties  firms  whose revenues depends significantly on the above activities are thus potentially exposed to transition risks and opportunities. Further, investors’ portfolios have to be part of the analysis since changes in financial assets  values  affect  the  stability  of  financial  institutions  and  can  thus  feed  back  into  the  transition dynamics  itself  (e.g.  through  cost  of  debt  for  firms  and  through  costs  for  assisting  the  financial sector).One  outstanding  challenge  for  the  analysis  of  investors’  exposure  to  climate  risks  is  the difficulty  to gather  granular  and  standardised information  on  the  breakdown  of  non-financial  firms’ revenues and capex in terms of low/high-carbon activities (high confidence).  Several financial super visors have conducted assessments of transition risk for the financial system at the  regional  level. For instance, the European Central Bank (ECB) reported  preliminary estimates of aggregate exposures of financial institutions to CPRS relative to their total debt securities  holdings,  as ranging between 1% for banks to about 9% for investment funds (ECB 2019). The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reported aggregate exposures to CPRS of EU insurance companies at about 13% of their total securities holdings (EIOPA 2018). Further analyses on the EU securities  holdings  indicate  that  among  financial  investments  in  bonds  issued  by  non-financial corporations, EU institutions hold exposures to CPRS ranging between 36.8%for investment funds to 47.7% for insurance corporations; analogous figures for equity holdings range from  36.4%  for  banks to  43.1% for  pension  funds (Alessi et al. 2019).  Another  study  indicates  that losses on EU insurance portfolios of sovereign bonds could reach up to 1%, in conservative scenarios (Battiston et al. 2019). Given the magnitude of the assets that are potentially exposed, reported in the previously cited studies, a delayed or uncoordinated transition risk can have implications for financial stability not only at the level of individual financial institutions, but also at the macro-level. The possible systemic nature of climate financial risk has been highlighted on the basis of general equilibrium economic analysis (Stern and Stiglitz 2021). Some financial authorities recognize that Climate change represents a major source of systemic risk, particularly for banks with portfolios concentrated in certain economic sectors or geographical areas (de Guindos 2021). Specifically, the concern that central banks would have to act as “climate rescuers of last resort” in a systemic financial crisis stemming from some combination of physical and transition risk has been raised in the financial supervisor community (Bolton et al. 2020). The systemic nature of climate risk is reinforced by the possible presence of moral hazard. Indeed, if many enough financial actors have an incentive to downplay climate-related financial risk, then systemic risk builds up in the financial system eventually materialising for tax payers (Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee 2020). While  such  type  or  risk may  go  undetected to  standard market  indicators  for  a  while,  it  can materialise with a time delay, similarly to the developments observed in the run up of the 2008 financial crisis.  These considerations are part of an ongoing discussion on whether the current financial frameworks, including  Basel  III,  should  incorporate  explicitly  climate  risk  as  a  systemic  risk.  In  particular,  the challenges  in  quantifying  the  extent  of  climate  risk,  reviewed  in  this  section,  especially  if  risk  is systemic, raise the question whether a combination of quantitative and qualitative restrictions on banks’ portfolios could be put in place to limit the build-up of climate risks (Baranović et al. 2021).

One fundamental challenge is that climate-related financial risk is endogenous (high confidence). This means that the perception of the risk changes the risk  itself,  unlike  most  contexts  of  financial  risk.  Indeed,  transition  risk  depends  on  whether governments  and  firms  continue  on  a  business-as-usual  pathway  (i.e.  misaligned  with  the  Paris Agreement  targets) or engage on  a  climate  mitigation  pathway.  But  the  realisation  of  the transition pathway depends itself on how, collectively,  society,  including  financial  investors  and  supervisors, perceive  the  risk  of  taking  / not taking the transition scenario. The circularity between perception of risk and realisation of the scenario simplifies first of all those multiple scenarios are possible, and that which scenario is ultimately realised can depend on policy action. The coordination problem associated also with low-carbon investments opportunities increases the uncertainty. Further, not all low-carbon activities are directly functional to the transition (e.g. investments in pharmaceutical, IT companies, or financial intermediaries), thus not all reallocations of capital lead to the same path. In  this  context,  probabilities  of  occurrence  of  scenarios  are  difficult  to assess and this is important because risk vary widely across the different scenarios. In this context a major challenge is the fat-tail nature of  physical  risk.  One  the  one  hand,  forecasts  of climate change and its impact on humans and ecosystems imply tail events (Weitzman 2014) and tipping points which cannot be overcome by model consensus  (Knutti  2010).  On  the  other  hand,  everything  else  the  same,  costs  and  benefits  vary substantially with assumptions on agents’ utility, productivity, and intertemporal discount rate, which ultimately  depend  on  philosophical  and  ethical  considerations (see  (Nordhaus 2007; Nicholas Stern 2008;  Pindyck  2013).  Thus,  more  knowledge  is  needed  on  the interaction  of  climate  physical  and transition  risk,  the  possible  reinforcing feedbacks  and  transmission  channels to the  economy and  to finance. Moreover, models need to account for compound risk, i.e. the interaction of climate physical and/ or transition risk with other sources of risk such as pandemics, as the COVID-19. Challenges for  climate  transition  scenarios.  The  endogeneity  of  risk  and  its  associated  deep uncertainty implies that the standard approach to financial risk consisting of computing expected values and risk based on historical values of market prices, is not adequate for climate risk (Bolton et al. 2020) (high confidence). To address this challenge, a recent stream of work has developed an approach to make use of climate policy  scenarios  to  derive  risk  measures  (e.g.  expected  shortfall)  for  financial assets  and  portfolios,  conditioned  to  scenarios  of  disorderly  transition  (Battiston  et  al.  2017; Monasterolo  and  Battiston  2020;  Roncoroni  et  al.  2020). In particular, climate policy shocks on the output  of  low/high  carbon  economic  activities  are  calculated  based  on  trajectories  of  energy technologies  as  provided  by  large-  scale  Integrated  Assessment  Models  (Kriegler  et  al.  2015; McCollum  et  al.  2018)  conditioned  to  the  introduction  of  specific  climate  policies  over  time.  This approach allows to conduct climate stress-test both at the level of financial institutions and at the level of the financial system of a given jurisdiction.  In a similar spirit, recently, the community of financial supervisors in collaboration with the community of  climate  economics  has identified a  set  of  climate policy scenarios,  based  on large-scale  IAM,  as candidate scenarios for assessing transition risk (Monasterolo and Battiston 2020). These scenarios have been used for instance, in an assessment of transition risk conducted at a national central bank (Allen et al. 2020). This development is key to mainstreaming the assessment of transition risk among financial institutions, but the following challenges emerge (high confidence). First, a consensus among financial supervisors  and  actors  on  scenarios  of  transition  risk  that  are  too  mild  could  lead  to  a  systematic underestimation of risk. The reason is that the default probability of leveraged financial institutions is sensitive  to  errors  in  the  estimation  of  the  loss  distribution  and  hence  sensitive  on  the  choice  of transition scenarios  (Battiston and Monasterolo 2020).  This  in  turn  could  lead  to  an  allocation  of capital  across  low/high  carbon activities that is insufficient to cater for the investment needs of the low-carbon transition.

In particular, IAMs solve for least cost pathways to an emissions target in 2100 (AR4 WGIII SPM Box 3), while the financial sector’s time horizon is much shorter and risk is an important factor in investment decision.  Third, the current modelling frameworks used to develop climate mitigation scenarios, which are based on large-scale IAM, assume that the financial system acts always as an enabler and do not account for the fact that, under some condition (i.e. if there is underestimation of climate transition risk) can also act as a barrier to the transition (Battiston et al. 2020a) because it invests disproportionately more in high carbon activities. Macroeconomic implications of the technological transition. Global macroeconomic changes that may  affect  asset  prices  are  expected  to  take  place  as  a  result  of  a  possible  reduction  in  growth  or contraction of fossil fuel demand, in scenarios in which climate targets are met according to carbon budgets, but also following ongoing energy efficiency changes ((Mercure et al. 2018a); see also (Clarke et al. 2014)) (high confidence). A review  of  the  economic  mechanisms  involved  in  the  accumulation of  systemic  risk associated to declining industries, with focus on fossil fuels, is given by (Semieniuk et al. 2021). An example is the transport sector, which uses around 50% of oil extracted (IEA 2018; Thomä  2018).    A  rapid diffusion of electric vehicles (and other alternative vehicle types), poses an important risk of as it could lead to oil demand peaking before 2050 far before mid-century (Mercure et al. 2018b; Mercure  et al. 2021). New technologies and fuel switching in aviation,  heavy industry and  shipping  could  further  displace liquid fossil fuel demand (IEA 2017). A rapid diffusion of solar photovoltaic could displace electricity generation based  predominantly on coal and  gas (Sussams and Leaton 2017).  A  rapid  diffusion  of household and  commercial  indoor  heating  and cooling  based  on electricity could further reduce the demand for oil, coal and gas (Knobloch et al. 2019). Parallels can be  made  with  earlier  literature  on  great  waves  of  innovation,  eras  of  clustered  technological innovation  and  diffusion  between  which periods  of  economic,  financial  and  social  instability  have emerged (Freeman and Louca 2001; Perez 2009). Due  to  the  predominantly  international  nature  of  fossil  fuel  markets,  assets  may  be  at  risk  from regulatory  and technological  changes  both  domestically  and  in  foreign  countries  (medium confidence).  Fossil-fuel  exporting  nations  with  lower  competitiveness  could  lose  substantial amounts of industrial activity and employment in scenarios of peaking or declining demand for fossil fuels. In scenarios of peaking oil demand, production is likely to concentrate towards the Middle-East and OPEC  countries  (IEA 2017).  Since  state-owned  fossil  fuel  companies  tend  to  enjoy  lower production  cost,  privately-owned  fossil  fuel  companies  are  more  at  risk (Thomä 2018).  Losses  of employment  may be  directly linked to losses  of  fossil-related  industrial  activity or indirectly linked through losses of large institutions, notably of government income from extraction royalties and export duties.  A  multiplier  effect  may  take  place  making  losses  of  employment  spill  out  of  fossil  fuel extraction, transformation and transportation sectors into other supplying sectors (Mercure et al. 2018a). Main regulatory developments and voluntary responses to climate risk. Framing climate risk as a financial risk (not just as an ethical issue) is key for it to become an actionable criteria for investment decision among mainstream investors (TCFD 2019) (high confidence). Since 2015 financial supervisors and central banks  (e.g. the Financial  Stability Board,  the G20  Green Finance Study Group, and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)) have played a central role in raising awareness and increase transparency  of  the  potential  material  financial  impacts  of  climate  change  within  the financial  sector  (Bank of England 2015, 2018; TCFD 2019). The NGFS initiative have engaged in particular in the elaboration of climate financial risk scenarios, as mentioned earlier.

Several  efforts  to  provide guidance and tools for the application of the TCFD recommendations have been made (using SASB Standards and the CDSB Framework to Enhance Climate-Related Financial Disclosures in Mainstream Reporting  TCFD  Implementation  Guide  (UNEP  FI  2018;  CDSB  and  SASB  2019).  Results  of voluntary reporting have been mixed, with one study pointing to unreliable and incomparable results reported by the US utilities sector to the CDP (Stanny 2018). There  have  been  also  similar  initiatives  at  the  national  level  (U.S. GCRP 2018; DNB 2017)(UK Government 2017). In particular, France was the first country to mandate climate risk disclosure from financial institutions (via Article 173 of the law on energy transition). However, disclosure responses have been so far mixed in scope and detail, with the majority of insurance companies not reporting on physical  risk (Evain et al. 2018).  In  the  UK,  mandatory  GHG  emissions  reporting  for  UK-listed companies has not led to substantial emissions reductions to date but could be laying the foundation for future mitigation (Tang and Demeritt 2018).  A key recent development is the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (TEG 2019), which provides a classification of economic activities that (among other dimensions) contribute to climate mitigation or can be enabling for the low-carbon transition. Indirectly, such classification provides useful information on investors’ exposure to transition risk (Alessi et al. 2019; ESMA 2020). Finally, many consultancies have  stepped  forward  offering  services  related  to  climate  risk.  However,  the methods are typically proprietary, non-transparent, or based primarily on carbon foot printing, which  is  a  necessary  but insufficient  measure  of  climate  risk.  Further,  ESG  (environmental,  social  and governance) metrics can useful but are, alone, inadequate to assess climate risk.   Illustrative mitigation pathways and financial risk for end-users of climate scenarios  Decision makers in financial risk management make increasingly use of climate policy scenarios, in line with the TCFD guidelines and the recommendations of the NGFS. In order to reduce the number of scenarios to consider, Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs, Chapter 3), have been elaborated to illustrate  key  features  that  characterise  the  possible  climate  (policy)  futures.  The  following considerations  can  be  useful  for  scenario  end-users  who  carry  out  risk  analyses  on  the  basis  of  the scenarios  described  in  Chapter  3.  It  is  possible  to  associate  climate  policy  scenarios  with  levels  of physical and/or transition risk, but these are not provided with the scenario data themselves.  On the one hand, each scenario is associated with a warming path, which in turn, on the basis of the results from WGII, implies certain levels of physical risk (see WGII Chapter 16). However, climate impacts are not accounted for in the scenarios. Moreover, levels of risk may vary with the Reason for Concern (RFC, ibidem) and with the speed in the implementation of adaptation. On the other hand, while mitigation can come with transition risk, in the case of lack of coordination among the actors, as discussed earlier in this section, this is not modelled explicitly in the trajectories, since the financial sector is not represented in underlying models. The scientific state of the art in climate-related financial risk offers an analysis that is not yet comprehensive of both the physical and transition risk dimensions in the same quantitative framework. However, decision makers can follow a mixed approach where they can combine quantitative risk assessment for transition risk with more qualitative risk analysis related to physical risk. Figure 15.6 represents sequences of events following along a scenario both in terms of physical risk (left) and transition risk (right). Four groups of IMPs (more are considered based on the warming level they lead to in 2100. Current Policies (CurPol) considers climate policies implemented in 2020 with only a gradual strengthening afterwards, leading to above 4°C warming (with respect to pre-industrial levels). Moderate Action (ModAct) explores the impact of implementing the NDCs (pledged mitigation Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-53  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 targets) as formulated in 2020 and some further strengthening afterwards, leading to below 4°C, but above 3°C warming. In these two scenarios, there is no stabilization of temperature, meaning that further warming occurs after 2100 (and higher risk) even if stabilization could be eventually achieved. They are  referred  to  as  pathways  with  higher  emissions.  The  warming  levels  reached  along  these  two scenarios imply physical risk levels that are “Moderate” until 2050 and very high in 2050-2100 (with low levels of adaptation). Noting, that “Moderate” physical can mean for some countries (i.e. SIDS) significant and even hardly absorbable consequences (i.e. reaching hard adaptation limits). Transition risk is not relevant for these scenarios, since a transition is not pursued.  Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMP) include two groups of scenarios consistent with warming levels of 1.5°C and &lt; 2°C, respectively. The two groups are representative for the IMPs defined in Chapter 3. In  these  scenarios,  warming  is  stabilized  before  2100.  The  warming  levels  along  these  paths  imply “Moderate”  physical  risk  until  2050  and  “High”  risk  in  2050-2100  (with  low  levels  of  adaptation). Transition risk can arise along these trajectories from changes in expectations of economic actors about which of the scenarios is about to materialise. These changes imply, in turn, possible large variations in the financial valuation of securities and contracts, with losses on the portfolio of institutional investors and  households.  High  policy  credibility  is  key  to  avoid  transition  risk,  by  making  expectations consistent  early  on  with  the  scenario.  Low  credibility  can  delay  the  adjustment  of  expectations  by several years, leading either to a late and sudden adjustment. However, if the policy never becomes credible, this changes the scenario since the initial target is not met. Figure 15.6 Schematic representation of climate scenarios in terms of both physical and transition risk. While the figure does not cover all possible events, it maps out how the combination of stated targets can lead to different paths in terms of risk, depending on implementation progress and policy credibility. IMP 1.5°C and IMP &lt; 2°C are representative for IMP-GS (Sens. Neg; Ren), IMP-Neg, IMP-LD; IMP-Ren; IMP-SP. Note that the figure defines "High" progress as higher, but it is important that the physical risk varies by region and country. This means, that “Moderate” physical risk can be significant and even hardly absorbable for some countries. 20 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-54  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS   Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 15.6.2  Enabling environments  The Paris Agreement recognised for the first time the key role of aligning financial flows to climate goals. It further emphasises the importance of making financial flows to consistent with climate actions and SDGs  (Zamarioli et al. 2021).This alignment has now to be operated in a specific environment where the scaling-up of climate policies is conditional upon their contribution to post-Covid recovery packages (see 15.2.2, 15.2.3 and Box 15.6). The enabling environments are to be established account for the structural parameters of the underinvestment on long-term assets. The persistent gap between the ‘propensity to save’ and ‘propensity to invest’ (Summers 2016) obstructs the scaling up of climate investments, and it results from a short-term bias of economic and financial decision making (Miles 1993;  Bushee  2001;  Black  and  Fraser  2002)  that  returns  weighted  on  short-term  risk  dominate  the investment horizon of financial actors. Overcoming this bias is the objective of an enabling environment apt  to  launch  of  a  self-reinforcing  circle  of  trust  between  project  initiators,  industry,  institutional investors, the banking system, and governments.  The role of government is crucial for creating an enabling environment for climate (Clark 2018), and governments are critical in the launching and maintenance of this circle of trust by lowering the political, regulatory  risks,  macroeconomic  and  business  risks  (high  confidence).  The  issue  is  not  just  to progressively enlarge the space of low-carbon investments but replacing one system (fossil fuels energy system) rapidly by another (low-carbon energy system). This is a wave of ‘creative destruction’ with the public support to developing new markets and new entrepreneurship and finance for green products and  technologies  in  a  context  which  requires  strong  complementarities  between  Schumpeterian (technological) and Keynesian (demand-related) policies (Dosi et al. 2017). However, it is challenging to  overcome  the  constraint  of  public  budget  under  the  pressure  of  competing  demands  and  of creditworthy constraints for countries that do not have an easy access to reserve currencies. It is needed to maximize, both at the national and international levels, the leverage ratio of public funds engaged in blended  finance  for  climate  change  which  is  currently  very  low,  especially  in  developing  countries (Attridge and Engen 2019).  Transparency: Policy de-risking measures, such as robust policy design and better transparency, as well  as  financial  de-risking  measures,  such  as  green  bonds  and  guarantees,  in  both  domestic  and international level, enhance the attractiveness of clean energy investments (Steckel and Jakob 2018) (high  confidence).  Organizations  such  as  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) can help increase capital markets’ climate financing, including private sector, by providing financial  markets  with  information  to  price  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities  (TCFD  2020). However, risk  disclosures alone  would  likely be insufficient  (Christophers  2017)  (high  confidence). Transparency can help but on its own as long as market failures that inhibit the emergence of low-carbon investment initiatives with positive risk-weighted returns (Ameli et al. 2020). Central banks and climate change. Central banks in all economies will likely have to play a critical role  in  supporting  the  financing  of  fiscal  operations  particularly  in  a  post-COVID  world  (high confidence).  Instruments  and  institutional  arrangements  for  better  international  monetary  policy coordination will likely be necessary in the context of growing external debt stress and negative credit rating  pressures  facing  both  emerging  and  low-income  countries.  Central  bankers  have  started examining  the  implications  of  disruptive  risks  of  climate  change,  as  part  of  their  core  mandate  of managing the stability of the financial system (Chenet et al. 2021). Climate-related risk assessments and disclosure, including central banks’ stress testing of climate change risks can be considered as a first  step  (Rudebusch  2019),  although  such  risk  assessments  and  disclosure  may  not  be  enough  by themselves to spur increased institutional low-carbon climate finance (Ameli et al. 2020). Green QE is now being examined as a tool for enabling climate investments (Dafermos et al. 2018) in which central banks could explicitly conduct a program of purchases of low-carbon assets (Aglietta et al.  2015).  A  green  QE  program  ‘would  have  the  benefit  of  providing  large  amounts  of  additional Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-55  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 liquidity to companies interested’ in green projects (Campiglio et al. 2018) (medium confidence). Green QE  would  have  positive  effects  for  stimulating  a  low-carbon  transition,  such  as  accelerating  the development of green bond markets (Hilmi et al. 2021), encouraging investments and banking reserves, and  reducing  risks  of  stranded  assets,  while  it  might  increase  the  income  inequality  and  financial instability  (Monasterolo  and  Raberto  2017).  While  the  short-term  effectiveness  would  not  be substantial, the central bank’s purchase of green bonds could have a positive effect on green investment in the long run (Dafermos et al. 2018). However, the use of green QE needs to be cautious on potential issues, such as undermining central bank’s independence, affecting central bank’s portfolio by including green  assets  with  poor  financial  risk  standards,  and  potential  regulatory  capture  and  rent  seeking behaviours (Krogstrup and Oman 2019).  Additional monetary policies and macroprudential financial regulation may facilitate the expected role of  carbon  pricing  on  boosting  low-carbon  investments  (D’Orazio  and  Popoyan  2019)  (medium confidence). Commercial banks may not respond to the price signal and allocate credits to low-carbon investments  due  to  the  existence  of  market  failure  (Campiglio  2016).  This  could  support  the productivity of green capital goods and encourage green investments in the short-term, but might cause financial  instability  by  raising  non-performing  loans  ratio  of  dirty  investments  and  creating  green bubbles (Dunz et al. 2021). Financial supervisors needs to implement stricter guidelines to overcome the greenwashing challenges (Caldecott 2020).  Efficient  Financial  Markets  and  Financial  Regulation.  An  influential  efficient  financial  markets hypothesis (Fama 1970, 1991, 1997) proceeds from the assumption that in well-developed financial markets, available information at any point of time is already well captured in capital markets with many participants. Despite an increasing challenges to the theory (Sewell 2011), especially by repeated episodes of global financial crashes and crises, and other widely noted anomalies, a weaker form of the efficient  markets  hypothesis  may  still  apply  (medium  confidence).  It  is  arguable  that  accumulating scientific evidence of climate impacts is being accompanied by rising levels of climate finance. Banks and  institutional  investors  are  also  progressively  rebalancing  their  investment  portfolios  away  from fossil-fuels and towards low-carbon investments (IEA 2019b; Monasterolo and de Angelis 2020). In the  meantime,  the  world  runs  the  risk  of  sharp  adjustments,  crises  and  irreversible  ‘tipping  points’ (Lontzek et al. 2015) sufficiently destabilizing climate outcomes. This leads to the policy prescription towards  financial  regulatory  agencies  requiring  greater  and  swifter  disclosure  of  information  about rising climate risks faced by financial institutions in projects and portfolios and central bank attention to systemic climate risk problems as one possible route of policy action (Carney 2015; Dietz et al. 2016; Zenghelis  and  Stern  2016;  Campiglio  et  al.  2018).  However,  disclosure  requirements  of  risks  and information in private settings remain mostly voluntary and difficult to implement (Battiston et al. 2017; Monasterolo et al. 2017).  Nevertheless,  financial  markets  are  innovating  in  search  of  solutions  (see  15.6.6).  Recognizing  and dealing with stranded fossil-fuel assets is also a key area of growing concern that financial institutions are beginning to grapple with. Larger institutions with more patient capital (pensions, insurance) are also increasingly beginning to enter the financing of projects and green bond markets. The case for efficient financial markets in developing countries is worse (Abbasi and Riaz 2016; Hong et al. 2019) because  of  weaker  financial  institutions  (Hamid  et  al.  2017),  heightened  credit  rationing  behaviour (Bond et al. 2015), and high-risk aversion as most markets are rated as junk, or below/barely investment grade  (Hanusch  et  al.  2016).  Other  constraints  such  as  limited  long-term  financial  instruments  and underdeveloped  domestic  capital  markets,  absence  of  significant  domestic  bond  markets  for investments  other  than  sovereign  borrowing,  and  inadequate  term  and  tenor  of  financing,  make  the efficient markets thesis practically inapplicable for most developing countries.  Markets, finance and creative destruction. Branches of macro-innovation theory could be grouped into  two  principal  classes  (Mercure  et  al.  2016):  ‘equilibrium  –  optimisation’  theories  that  treat Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-56  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 innovators as rational perfectly informed agents and reaching equilibrium under market price signals; and the other ‘non-equilibrium’ theory where market choices are shaped by history and institutional forces and the role of public policy is to intervene in processes, given a historical context, to promote a better outcome or new economic trajectory. The latter suggests that new technologies might not find their way to the market without price or regulatory policies to reduce uncertainty on expected economic returns. A key issue is the perception of risk by investors and financial institutions. The financial system is  part  of complex  policy packages  involving  multiple  instruments (cutting  subsidies to fossil fuels, supporting clean energy innovation and diffusion, levelling the institutional playing field and making risks transparent) (Polzin 2017) and the needed big systemic push (Kern and Rogge 2016) requires it takes on the role of ‘institutional innovation intermediaries’ (Polzin et al. 2016).  As far as climate finance is concerned, public R&amp;D support had large cross-border knowledge spill-overs  indicating  that  openness  to  trade  was  important,  capacity  expansion  had  positive  effects  on learning-by-doing on innovation over time, and that feed-in-tariffs (FiTs), in particular, had positive impacts on technology diffusion (Grafström and Lindman 2017) (see box 16.4 for further findings of public R&amp;D on energy technologies). The FiTs program has been associated with rapid increase in early renewables capacity expansion across the world by reducing market risks in financing and stability in project  revenues  (Menanteau  et  al.  2003;  Jacobsson  et  al.  2009).  (see  Chapter  9.9.5).  Competitive auctions that the successful bidder with the lowest price or other criteria is selected for government’s call for tender are increasing being utilised as an alternative to FITs due their strengths of flexibility, potential for real price discovery, ability to ensure greater certainty in price and quantity and capability to guarantee commitments and transparency (IRENA and CEM 2015).  Outside of RE, scattered but numerous examples are available on the role of innovative public policy to spur and create new markets and technologies (Arent et al. 2017): i) pro-active role of the state in energy transitions (the retirement of all coal-fired power plants in Ontario, Canada between 2007 and 2014 (Kern and Rogge 2016; Sovacool 2016), ii) Too early exit and design problems not considering the  market  acceptability  and  financing  issues  (e.g.,  energy-efficient  retrofitting  in  housing  in  UK (Rosenow  and  Eyre  2016),  low  or  negative  returns  in  reality  versus  engineering  estimates  in weatherisation programs in US (Fowlie et al. 2018)), iii) Energy performance contracting for sharing the business risks and profits and improving energy efficiency (Energy service company (Bertoldi and Boza-Kiss 2017; Qin et al. 2017) and Utility Energy Service Contracts in the US (Clark 2018)).  Crowding out. Literature has discussed the risks of a low effectiveness of public interventions and of a crowding out effects of climate targeted public support to other innovation sectors  (Buchner et al. 2013). However, much academic literature suggests no strong evidence of crowding out. (Deleidi et al. 2020). Examining the effect of public investment on private investment into renewables in 17 countries over 2004-2014, showed that the concept of crowding out or in does not apply well to sectoral studies and found that public investments positively support private investments in general.  Support of climate action via carbon pricing, taxes, and emission trading systems. Literature and evidence suggest that futures markets regarding climate are incomplete because they do not price in externalities (Scholtens 2017). As a result, low-carbon investments do not take place to socially and economically optimal levels, and the correct market signals would involve setting carbon prices high enough or equivalent trading in reduced carbon emissions by regulatory action to induce sufficient and faster  shift  towards  low-carbon  investments  (Aghion  et  al.  2016)  (high  confidence).  Nonetheless, durable  carbon  pricing  in  economic  and  political  systems  must  be  implemented  and  approached combining related elements to both price and quantity (Grubb 2014).  The  introduction  of  fiscal  measures,  such  as  carbon  tax,  or  market-based  pricing,  such  as  emission trading  scheme,  to  reflect  carbon  pricing  have  benefits  and  drawbacks  that  policymakers  need  to consider both country-specific conditions and policy characteristics. Carbon tax can be a simpler and easier  way  to  implement  carbon  pricing,  especially  in  developing  countries,  because  countries  can Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-57  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 utilise  the  existing  fiscal  tools  and  do  not  need  a  concrete  enabling  conditions  as  market-based frameworks (high confidence). The reallocation of revenues from carbon taxes can be used for low-carbon investments, supporting poorer sections of society and fostering technological change  (High-Level  Commission  on  Carbon  Prices  2017).  In  combination  with  other  policies,  such  as  subsidies, public R&amp;Ds on resource-saving technologies, properly designed carbon taxes can facilitate the shift towards low-carbon, resource-efficient investments (Bovari et al. 2018; Naqvi and Stockhammer 2018; Dunz et al. 2021). (see Chapter 9.9.3 for carbon taxes). The effectiveness of carbon pricing has been supported  by  various  evidences.  EU  ETS  has  been  cut  the  emissions  by  42.8%  in  the  main  sectors covered  (European  Commission  2021a),  and  China  had  achieved  emissions  reductions  and  energy conservations  through  its  pilot  ETS  between  2013  and  2015  (Hu  et  al.  2020;  Zhang  et  al.  2019). Institutional  learning,  administrative  prudence,  appropriate  carbon  revenue  management  and stakeholder engagement are key ingredients for successful ETS regimes (Narassimhan et al. 2018).  The presence of carbon prices can promote low-carbon technologies and investments (Best and Burke 2018),  and  price  signals,  including  carbon  taxation,  provide  powerful  and  efficient  incentives  for households and firms to reduce CO2 emissions (IMF 2019). The expansion of carbon prices is dependent on  country-specific  fiscal  and  social  policies  to  hedge  against  regressive  impacts  on  welfare, competitiveness, and employment (Michaelowa et al. 2018). Such impacts need to be offset using the proceeds of carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances to reduce distortive taxation  (Bovenberg and  de  Mooij  1994;  Goulder  1995;  de  Mooij  2000;  Chiroleu-Assouline  and  Fodha  2014)  and  fund compensating measures for the population sections that are most adversely impacted  (Combet et al. 2010; Jaccard 2012; Klenert et al. 2018). This is more difficult for developing countries with a large share of energy-intensive activities, fossil fuels exporting countries and  countries which have lower potential to mitigate impacts due to lower wages or existing taxes (Lefèvre et al. 2018).  Non-carbon  price  instruments,  such  as  market-oriented  regulation,  public  programs  involving  low carbon infrastructure, may be preferential in developing countries where market and regulatory failure and  political economy constraints  are more  prevalent  (Finon  2019).  .  While  the  carbon  pricing  was suggested by many economists and researchers (Nordhaus 2015; Pahle et al. 2018), overcoming the political  and  regulatory  barriers  would  be  necessary  for  the  further  implementation  of  an  effective carbon pricing nationally and internationally. Without the strong political support, the effectiveness of carbon pricing would be limited to least-cost movements (Meckling et al. 2015). Role of domestic financing sources. Efforts to address climate change can be scaled up through the mobilisation  of  domestic  funds  (Fonta  et  al.  2018).  Publicly  organised  and  supported  low-carbon infrastructures through resurrected national development banks may be justified (Mazzucato and Penna 2016). It is important to efficiently allocate the public financing, and  SIBs can take up key roles (i) to provide capital to assist with overcoming financial barriers, (ii) to signal and direct investments towards green projects, and (iii) to attract the private investors by taking up a de-risking role. Also, they can become a first mover by investing in new and innovative technologies or business models (Geddes et al.  2018).  State  owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  can  also  have  an  overall  positive  effect  on  renewables investments,  outweighing  any  effect  of  crowding  out  private  competitors  (Prag  et  al.  2018).  Green investment  banks  (GIB)  can  assist  in  the  green  transition  by  developing  valuable  expertise  in implementing  effective  public  interventions  to  overcome  investment  barriers  and  mobilise  private investment  in  infrastructure  (OECD  2015c).  De-risking  measures  may  reduce  investment  risks,  but lacking  research  and  data  availability  hinders  designing  such  measures  (Dietz  et  al.  2016).

Many  proposals  have  emerged  for  multilateral  guarantee funds:  Green  Infrastructure  Funds  (de  Gouvello  and  Zelenko  2010;  Studart  and  Gallagher  2015), Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (Enhanced  Green  MIGA)  (Déau  and  Touati  2018), guarantee funds to bridge the infrastructure investment gap (Arezki et al. 2016), and multi-sovereign guarantee  mechanisms  (Dasgupta  et  al.  2019).  The  obstacle  of  limited  fiscal  space  for  economic recovery and climate actions in low-income and some emerging economies can be overcome only in a multilateral  setting.  Several  multilateral  actions  are  being  envisaged:  G20’s  suspension  of  official bilateral debt payments, IMF’s adoption of new SDRs allocation (IMF 2021b). However, any form of unconventional debt relief will generate development and climate benefits only if they credibly target bridging the countries’ infrastructure gap with low-carbon climate-resilient options. An interest of multilateral setting is a credibility-enhancing effect provided by reciprocal gains for both the donor and the host country. Guarantor countries can compensate the public cost of their commitments with the fiscal revenues of induced exports. As to the host countries, they would benefit from new capital inflows and the grant equivalents of reduced debt service which might potentially go far  beyond 100 billion USD yr-1 (Hourcade et al. 2021a). A second interest would be to support a learning process about agreed-upon  assessment  and  monitoring  methods  using  clear  metrics.  Developing  standardized  and science-based assessment methods at low transaction costs is essential to  strengthen the credibility of green  investments  and  the  emergence  a  pipeline  of  high-quality  bankable  projects  which  can  be capitalized in the form of credible assets and supported with transparent and credible domestic spending. Multi-sovereign  guarantees  would  provide  a  quality  backing  to  developing  countries  and  allow  for expanding developing countries' access to capital markets at a lower cost and longer maturities, overcome the Basel III’s liquidity impediment and the EU's Solvency II directive on liquidity  (Blended Finance Taskforce  2018b),  accelerate  the  recognition  of  climate  assets  by  investors  seeking  safe  investments havens (Hourcade et al. 2021b). It would also strengthen the efficacy of climate disclosure through high grades climate assets and minimize the risks of 'greening' of the portfolios by investing in 'carbon neutral' activities and not in low carbon infrastructures. Finally, it would free up grant capacities for SDGs and adaptation  that  mostly  involve  non-marketable  activities  by  crowding  in  private  investments  for marketable mitigation activities. *** START BOX 15.5 **** Box 15.5 The role of enabling environments for decreasing-economic cost of renewable energy  A widely used indicator for the relative attractiveness of renewable energy but also development of price levels is the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). It is applied by a wide range of public and private stakeholders  when  tracking  progress  with  regard  to  cost  degression  (Aldersey-Williams  and  Rubert 2019). LCOE calculation methodologies vary but in principle, consider project-level costs only (NEA 1989). Besides other weaknesses, the LCOE concept usually does not consider societal costs resulting from de-risking instruments and/or other public interventions/support and therefore caution has to be applied when using the LCOE as the indicator sole of the success of enabling environments. The yearly IRENA  mapping  on  renewable  energy  auction  results  demonstrates  the  extremely  broad  ranges  of LCOEs (equal to the agreed tariffs) for renewable energy which can be observed (IRENA 2019a). For example, in 2018, solar PV LCOEs for utility-scale projects came in between 0.04 USD/kWh and 0.35 USD/kWh with a global weighted average of 0.085 USD/kWh. However, comparative analysis taking into account societal costs are hardly available driven by challenges in the context of the quantification of public support.

With a focus on developing countries and based on a case study in Thailand, (Huenteler et al. 2016) demonstrate the significant effect of regulatory environments but also local learning and skilled workforce on cost of renewables. The effect of those exceeds the one of global technology learning curves. (Egli  et  al.  2018)  identify  macroeconomic  conditions  (general  interest  rate)  and  experience  effects within  the  renewable  energy  finance  industry  as  key  drivers  in  developed  countries  with  a  stable regulatory environment contributing 5% (PV) and 24% (wind) to the observed reductions in LCOEs in the German market with a relatively stable regulatory environment. They conclude that ‘extant studies may overestimate technological learning and that increases in the general interest rate may increase renewable energies’ LCOEs, casting doubt on the efficacy of plans to phase out policy support’ (Egli et al.  2018). A  rising  general interest rate level  could heavily  impact  LCOEs  –  for  Germany,  a  rise  of interest rates to pre-financial crisis levels in five years could increase LCOEs of solar and wind by 11–25% respectively (Schmidt et al. 2019). *** END BOX 15.5 **** 15.6.2.1  The public-private and mobilization narrative and current initiatives Financing by development finance institutions and development banks aims to address market failures and barriers related to limited access to capital as well as provides direct and indirect subsidisation by accepting higher risk, longer loan tenors and/or lower pricing. Many development and climate projects in  developing and  emerging  countries  have traditionally  been supported  with  concessional loans  by DFIs/IFIs. With an increasing number of sectors becoming viable and increasing complaints of private sector players with regard to crowding-out (Bahal et al. 2018), a stronger separation and crowding-in of commercial financing at the project/asset level is targeted. MDBs and IFIs were crucial for opening and growth in the early years of the green bonds, which represent a substantial share of issuances (CBI 2019a).  Drivers  of  an  efficient  private  sector  involvement  are  stronger  incentives  to  have  projects delivered on time and in budget as well as market competition (Hodge et al. 2018). It remains key that the private sector mobilization goes hand in hand with institutional capacity building as well as strong sectoral development in the host country as a strong, knowledgeable public partner with the ability to manage the private sector is a dominating success factor for public-private cooperation (WEF 2013; Yescombe 2017; Hodge et al. 2018). Limited research is available on the efficiency of mobilization of the private sector at the various levels and/or  the  theory  of  change  attached  to  the  different  approaches  as  applied  in  classical  PPP.  Also, transparency  on  current  flows  and  private  involvement  at  the  various  levels  is  limited  with  no differentiation being made in reporting (e.g., GCF co-financing reporting). Limited prioritization and agreement on prioritization on sectors and/or project categories being ready and/or preferred for direct private  sector  involvement  which  might  become  a  challenge  in  the  coming  years  (Sudmant  et  al. 2017a,b) (high confidence).  Public  guarantees  have  been  increasingly  proposed  to  expand  climate  finance,  especially  from  the private sector, with scarce public finance, by reducing the risk premium of the low-carbon investment opportunities (de Gouvello and Zelenko 2010; Emin et al. 2014; Studart and Gallagher 2015; Schiff and Dithrich 2017; Lee et al. 2018; Steckel and Jakob 2018). They have the advantage of a broad coverage including the 'macro' country risks and to tackle the up-front risks, during the preparation, bidding and development phases of the project life cycle that deter projects initiators especially for capital intensive and immature options. Insurances are also powerful de-risking instruments  (Déau and Touati 2018) but they  entitle  the  issuer  to  review  claims  concerning  events  and  cannot  cope  with  up-front  costs.

Combined with emission taxes they can contribute to reducing credit rationing of immature and risky low-carbon technologies (Haas and Kempa 2020). 15.6.3  Considerations on availability and effectiveness of public sector funding The gap analysis as well as other considerations presented in this chapter illustrate the critical role of increased volumes and efficient allocation of public finance to reach the long-term global goals, both nationally and internationally.  Higher public spending levels driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and related recovery packages. Higher  levels  of  public  funding  represent  a  massive  chance  but  also  a  substantial  risk.  A  missing alignment  of  public  funding  and  investment  activity  with  the  Paris  Agreement  (and  sustainable development  goals)  would  result  in  significant  carbon  lock-ins,  stranded  assets  and  thus  increase transition risks and ultimately economic costs of the transition (high confidence). Using IMF data for stimulus packages, (Andrijevic et al. 2020) estimated that COVID-19 related fiscal expenditure had surpassed 12 trillion USD by October 2020 (80% in OECD countries), a third of which being spent in liquidity support and healthcare. Total stimulus pledged to date are ten times higher than low-Paris-consistent carbon investment needs from 2020–2024 (Andrijevic et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020). Overall,  stimulus  packages  launched  include  3.5  trillion  USD  to  sectors  directly  affecting  future emissions,  with  overall fossil-fuel investment flows  outweighing  low-carbon technology  investment (Vivid Economics 2020). Lessons from the global financial crises show that although deep economic crises create a sharp short-term emission drop, and green stimulus is argued to be the ideal response to tackle both the economic and the climate crises at once, disparities between regional strategies hinder the low carbon transition (high  confidence).  Indeed,  inconsistent  policies  within  countries  can  also  counterbalance  emission reductions  from  green  stimulus,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  transparency  and  green  spending  pledged  not materialised (Jaeger et al. 2020). Also, aggressive monetary policy as a response to the global financial crisis, including quantitative easing that did not target low-carbon sectors, has been heavily criticised (Jaeger et al. 2020) . The COVID-19 crisis recovery, in contrast, benefits from developments which have taken place since, such as an emerging climate-risk awareness from the financial sector, reflected in the call from the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (Coalition of Finance Ministers for  Climate  Action  2020),  which  reunites  50  countries’  finance  ministers,  for  a  climate-resilient recovery.  The steep decrease in renewable electricity costs since 2010 also represents a relevant driver for a low carbon recovery (Jaeger et al. 2020). Many more sectors are starting to show similar opportunities for rapid growth with supportive public spending such as low-carbon transport and buildings (IEA 2020d). Expectations that the package will increase economic activity rely on the assumption that increased credit will have a positive effect on demand, the so-called demand-led policy (Mercure et al. 2019). Boosting investment should propel job creation, increasing household income and therefore demand across  economic  sectors  (high  confidence).  A  similar  plan  has  also  been  proposed  by  the  US administration and the European Union through the Next Generation EU (European Council 2020). Nevertheless, three uncertainties remain. First, only those countries and regions with highest credit-ratings (AAA or AA) with access to deep financial markets and excess savings will be able to mount such  counter-cyclical  climate  investment  paths,  typically  high-income  developed  economies  (high confidence). In more debt constrained developing countries have and lower access to global savings pool countries because of higher risk perceptions and lower credit ratings (BBB or less), exacerbated by COVID-19 and already leading to credit downgrades and defaults (Kose et al. 2020) and have long Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-61  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 tended  to  be  fiscally  pro-cyclical  (Mcmanus  and  Ozkan  2015).  These  include  the  general  class  of virtually all major emerging and especially low-income developing countries, to which such demand-stimulating  counter-cyclical  climate consistent  borrowing  path is likely  To access such funds, these countries  would  need  globally  coordinated  fiscal  policy  and  explicit  supporting  cross-border instruments, such as sovereign guarantees, strengthening local capital markets and boosting the 100 billion USD annual climate finance commitment (Dasgupta et al. 2019). Second, a strong assumption is that voters will be politically supportive of extended and increased fiscal deficit spending on climate on top of COVID-19 related emergency spending and governments will overcome treasury biases towards fiscal conservatism (to preserve credit ratings). However, evidence strongly  suggests  that  voters  (and  credit  rating  agencies)  tend  to  be  fiscally  conservative  (Peltzman 1992; Lowry et al. 1998; Alesina et al. 2011; Borge and Hopland 2020) especially where expenditures involve higher taxes in the future and do not identifiably flow back to their local bases (the ‘public good’ problem) (high confidence). Such mistrust has been a reason for abortive return to fiscal austerity often in the past (most recently during global financial crisis) and may benefit for political support by consistently  reframing  the  climate  expenditures  in  terms  of  job  creation  benefits  (Bougrine  2012), effectiveness of least-cost fiscal spending on climate for reviving private activity, and the avoidance of catastrophic losses (Huebscher et, al. 2020) from higher carbon emissions. A new understanding of debt sustainability including negative implications of deferred climate investments on future GDP has not yet been mainstreamed (see more on the debt sustainability discussion below (e.g. (Buhr et al. 2018; Fresnillo 2020)). In addition, implications on the availability of international public finance flows are not yet clear since current additional funding prioritises urgent healthcare support rather than an increase of  predictable  mid/long-term  financial  support.  Heavy  investment  needs  for  recovery  packages  in developed  countries  on the  one  hand  and  their international  climate  finance  commitments might  be perceived to compete for available “perceived as appropriate” budgets.  *** START BOX 15.6 **** Box 15.6 Macroeconomics and finance of a Post-COVID-19 green stimulus economic recovery path Financial  history  suggests  that  capital  markets  may  be  willing  to  accommodate  extended  public borrowing for transient spending spikes (Barro 1987) when macroeconomic conditions suggest excess savings relative to private investment opportunities (Summers 2015) and when public spending is seen as  timely,  effective  and  productive,  with  governments  able  to  repay  when  conditions  improve  as economic crisis conditions abate (high confidence). A surge in global climate mitigation spending in the  post-pandemic  recovery  may  be  an  important  opportunity,  which  global  capital  markets  are signalling  (Global  Investor  Statement  2019).  The  standard  ‘neo-classical’  macroeconomic  model  is often used in integrated energy-economy-climate assessments (Balint et al. 2016; Nordhaus 2018). This class  of  Computable  General  Equilibrium  (CGE)  models,  however,  have  a  limited  treatment  of  the financial sector and assume that all resources and factors of production are fully employed, there is no idle capacity and no inter-temporal financial intermediation (Pollitt and Mercure 2018b). Investment cannot assume larger values than the sum of previously determined savings, as a fixed proportion of income. Such constraint, as stressed by (Mercure et al. 2019), implies that investment in low-carbon infrastructure, under the equilibrium assumptions, necessarily creates a (neo-Ricardian) crowding-out effect that contracts the remaining sectors. The graphic below shows the implications (in the red-shaded part of Figure 1).  Post-Keynesian demand-side macroeconomic models, with financial sectors and supply-side effects, in contrast,  allow  for  the  reality  of  non-equilibrium  situations:  persistent  short  to  medium  term underemployed economy-wide resources and excess savings over investment because of unexpected shocks, such as COVID-19. In these settings, economic stimulus packages allow a faster recovery with Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-62  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 demand-led effects: “Economic multipliers are near zero when the economy operates near capacity. In contrast, during crises such as the GFC, economic multipliers can be high (Blanchard and Leigh 2013; Hepburn et al. 2020b). The expected results are opposite to the standard supply-led equilibrium models as  a  response  to investment  stimulus  (the  green-shaded  part of  Box  15.6,  Figure  1),  as  intended  by ‘green-stimulus’ packages such as proposed by the EU (Balint et al. 2016; Mercure et al. 2019).  Box 15.6, Figure 1 Two Worlds – Energy transition outcomes under alternative model assumptions (Keynesian vs General Equilibrium) Source: Mercure et al. (2019) Even  if  demand-led  models  work  better  in  depressions,  the  question  nevertheless  is  whether  the additional public borrowing for such ‘green stimulus’ can be undertaken by market borrowings given already high public debt levels and recovered in the future from taxes  as the economy revives. The results  of  recent  macroeconomic  modelling  work  (Liu  et  al.  2021)  represented  by  10  major countries/regions suggests answers. It uses a non-standard macroeconomic framework, with Keynesian features  such as financial and labour market rigidities and fiscal and monetary rules  (McKibbin and Wilcoxen  2013).  First,  a  global  ‘green  stimulus’  of  about  an  average  of  0.8%  of  GDP  annually  in additional fiscal spending between 2020-30 would be required to accelerate the emissions reduction path required for a 1.5°C transition. Second, such a stimulus would also accelerate the global recovery by boosting GDP growth rates by about 0.6% annually during the critical post-COVID period. Third, the optimal tax policy would be to backload the carbon taxes to later in the macroeconomic cycle, both because this would avoid dampening near-term growth while pre-announced carbon tax plans would incentivise  long-term  private  energy  transition  investment  decisions  today  and  provide  neutral borrowing. This macroeconomic modelling path thus replicates the ‘green stimulus’ impacts expected in theory (Box 15.6, Figure 1). There are also some other additional features of the modelled proposal: (a) fiscal stimulus—needed in the aftermath of the pandemic—can be an opportunity to boost green and resilient  public  infrastructure;  (b)  green  research  and  development  ‘subsidies’  are  feasible  to  boost technological  innovations;  and  (c)  income  transfers  to  lower  income  groups  are  necessary  to  offset negative impacts of rising carbon taxes.  Substantial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is relatively unique on its public health impacts when  combined  with  the  consequences  of  deep  economy-wide  shocks  (economic  downturn,  public finances,  and  debt),  are  expected  to  last  for  decades  even  in  the  absence  of  no  significant  future recurrence. A scenario where the pandemic recurs mildly every year for the foreseeable future further hinders GDP and investment recovery, where growth is unlikely to rebound to previous trajectories, even  within  OECD  economies  (McKibbin  and  Vines  2020)  and  with  worse  effects  in  developing regions.  History  is  strongly  supportive:  studies  on  the  longevity  of  pandemics’  impacts  indicate significant macroeconomic effects persisting for decades, with depressed real rates of return, increased precautionary savings (Jordà et al. 2020), unemployment (Rodríguez-Caballero and Vera-Valdés 2020) 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-63  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 and social unrest (Barrett and Chen 2021). The direct effect on emissions is likely to be a small reduction from previous trajectories, but the longer-lasting impacts are more on the macroeconomic-finance side. Pandemic responses have increased sovereign debt across countries in all income bands (IMF 2021e). However, its sharp increase in most developing economies and regions has caused debt distress (Bulow et al. 2021), widening the gap in developing countries’ access to capital (Hourcade et al. 2021b). While strong  coordinated  international  recovery  strategies  with  climate-compatible  economic  stimulus  is justified (Pollitt et al. 2021; Barbier 2020; Barbier and Burgess 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2021; IMF 2020c), national recovery packages announced do not show substantial alignment with climate goals (Shan et al. 2021; Rochedo et al. 2021; D’Orazio 2021; Hourcade et al. 2021b). Contradictory post-COVID-19 investments  in  fossil  fuel-based  infrastructure  may  create  new  carbon  lock-ins,  which  would  either hinder climate targets or create stranded assets (Hepburn et al. 2020a; Le Quéré et al. 2021; Shan et al. 2021), whilst deepening global inequalities (Hourcade et al. 2021b). *** END BOX 15.6 **** Considerations on global debt levels and debt sustainability as well as implications for climate finance. The Paris Agreement marked the consensus of the international community that a temperature increase of well below 2 degrees needs to be achieved and the SR1.5 has demonstrated the economic viability of 1.5°C. However, in terms of increase of supply of, in particular, public finance, often the debate is still driven by the question on affordability, considerations around financial debt sustainability and budgetary constraints against the background of macroeconomic headwinds  – even more in the (post-)COVID-19 world (high confidence). The level of climate alignment of debt is hardly considered in debt related regulation and/or debt sustainability agreements like the Maastricht Treaty ceilings (3% of GDP government deficit and 60% of GDP (gross) government debt) not considering economic costs of deferred climate action as well as economic benefits of the transformation. Robust studies on the economic costs and benefits in the short- to long-term of reaching the LTGG exist for only few countries and/or regions, primarily in the developed world (e.g. (BCG 2018; McKinsey 2020a)  (high  confidence).  With  many  studies  underpinning  the  strong  economic  rationale  for  high investments in the short-term e.g.(McKinsey 2020a) [More studies to be added], regional differences are significant highlighting the need for extensive cooperation and solidarity initiatives. For many developing countries, the focus of debt sustainability discussions is on the negative effect of climate  change  on  the  future  GDP  and  the  uncertainty  with  regard  to  short-term  effects  of  climate change and their economic implications (high confidence). With long-term economic impacts of climate change being in the focus of the modelling community, the volatility of GDP in the short term driven by shocks is more difficult to analyse and requires country-specific deep-dives. IPCC scenario data is often not sufficient to perform such analysis with additional assumptions being needed (Acevedo 2016) [Check for cross-referencing to WG1]. For debt sustainability analysis, these more short-term impacts are,  however, a  crucial  driver  with  transparency  being  limited to  the significance  of  climate-related revision of estimates. The latter might result in a continued overestimation of future GDP as happened in the past increasing the vulnerability of highly indebted countries  (Guzman 2016; Mallucci 2020). While  climate  change  considerations  have  already  impacted  country  ratings  and  debt  sustainability assessments (and financing costs), it is unclear whether current GDP forecasts are realistic. The review of the IMF debt sustainability framework leads to a stronger focus on vulnerability rather than only income thresholds when deciding upon eligibility for debt relief and/or concessional resources (Mitchell 2015), which could become a mitigation factor for the challenge described before.  Debt levels globally but particularly in developing and vulnerable countries have significantly increased over  the  past  years  with  current  and  expected  climate  change  impacts  further  burdening  debt sustainability (high confidence). For low and middle income countries, 2018 marked a new peak of debt levels amounting to 51% of GDP; between 2010 and 2018, external debt payments as a percentage of Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-64  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 government budget grew by 83% in low- and middle-income countries, from an average of 6.71% in 2010 to an average of 12.56% in 2018 (Eurodad 2020). COVID-19 has further reduced the fiscal space of many developing governments and/or increased the likelihood of debt stress. With many vulnerable countries already being burdened with higher financing costs, this limited fiscal space further shrinks their  ability  to  actively  steer  the  required  transformation  (Buhr  et  al.  2018).  Limited  progress  in increasing debt transparency remains another burden (see Section 15.6.7). Considering  the  need  for  responses  to  both,  short-term  liquidity  issues  and  long-term  fiscal  space, current G20/IMF/World Bank debt service suspension initiatives are focused the liquidity issue rather than underlying problems of more structural nature of many low-income (Fresnillo 2020). In order to ensure  fiscal  space  for  climate  action  in  the  coming  decade  a  mix  between  debt  relief,  deferrals  of liabilities, extended debt levels and sustainable lending practices including new solidarity structures need  to  be  considered  in  addition  to  higher  levels  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  lending  to  reduce dependency on capital markets and to bridge the availability of sustainably structured loans for highly vulnerable and indebted countries. More standardised debt-for-climate swaps, a higher share of GDP linked  bonds  or  structures  ensuring  (partial)  debt  cancellation  in  case  countries  are  hit  by  physical climate  change  impacts/shocks  appear  possible.  The  “hurricane”  clause  introduced  by  Grenada,  or wider natural disaster clauses provide issuers with an option to defer payments of interest and principal in the event of a qualifying natural disaster and can reduce short-term debt stress (UN AAAA Art. 102) (UN 2015a). A mainstreaming of such clauses has been pushed by various international institutions. The  collective  action  clause  might  be  a  good  example  of  a  loan/debt  term  which  became  market standard. Definition of triggers is likely the most complex challenge in this context.  The use of debt-for-nature and debt-for-climate-swaps is still very limited and not mainstreamed but offers significant potential if used correctly (high confidence).   An increasing number of debt-for-climate/nature swaps have been seen in recent years applied primarily in international climate cooperation and in bilateral contexts, however, not (yet) to  an extent addressing severe and acute debt crises (Essers et al. 2021; Volz et al. 2021) offering significant potential if used correctly  (Warland  and  Michaelowa  2015).    Significant  lead  times,  needs-based  structuring, transparency with regard to the additionality of financed climate action, uncertainty with regard to own resource constraints and ODA accountability remain as barrier for a massive scale-up needed to make transactions  relevant  (Mitchell  2015;  Fuller  et  al.  2018;  Essers  et  al.  2021).  At  the  same  time,  the limitation of the use of debt-based instruments as a response to climate-related disasters and counter-cyclical loans might be necessary (Griffith-Jones and Tyson 2010). Ensuring efficient debt restructuring and debt relief in events of extreme shocks and imminent over-indebtedness  and  sovereign  debt  default  are  further  crucial  elements  with  a  joint  responsibility  of debtors and creditors (UN 2015a) 2015). In this context, the Commonwealth Secretariat flagged that the diversification of the lender portfolio made debt restructuring more difficult with more and more heterogeneous stakeholders being involved (Mitchell 2015) and the UN AAAA raising concerns about non-cooperative creditors and disruption of timely completion of debt restructuring (UN 2015a) 2015). This is a side effect of a stronger use of capital markets, which need to be carefully considered in the context of sovereign bond issuances (see also 15.6.7).  Stranded assets. The debate around stranded assets focuses strongly on the loss of value to financial assets for investors (see Section 15.6.1, para. on the assessment of transition risk and carbon stranded assets), however, stranded asset and resources in the context of the transition towards a low emission economy “are expected to become a major economic burden for states and hence the tax payers” (EEAC 2016) (high confidence). Assets include not only financial assets but also infrastructure, equipment, contracts,  know-how,  jobs  as  well  as  stranded  resources  (Bos  and  Gupta  2019).  Besides  financial investors  and  fiscal  budgets,  consumers  remain  vulnerable  to  stranded  investments.

Recent phase-out deals tend to aim for a (partial or full) compensation rather than no relief for losses. In  contrast  to  the  line  of  argument  in  the  tobacco  industry,  the  backward  looking  approach  and  a resulting obligation of compensation by investors in polluting assets can be observed rarely with the forward looking approach of compensations by future winners for current losers dominating – despite the  high  level  of  awareness  about  carbon  externalities  and  resulting  climate  change  impacts  among polluters for many years (van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). In particular, transactions in the energy sector show a high level of investor protection also against much needed climate action which is also well illustrated by share of claims settled in favour of foreign investors under the Energy Charter Treaty and investor-state dispute settlement (Bos and Gupta 2019). Late government action can delay action and consequently strengthen the magnitude of action needed at a later point in time with implications on employment and economic development in impacted regions requiring higher level of fiscal burden (high confidence). This has also be considered in the context of global climate cooperation with prolonged support for polluting infrastructure resulting heavy lock-in effects and higher economic costs in the long-run (Bos and Gupta 2019). Despite a significant share of fossil resources which need to become stranded in developing countries to reach the LTGG, REDD+ remains a singular example for international financial cooperation in the context of compensation for stranded resources.

Total global estimate of damage is about 4,210 billion USD, 2000-2018 (Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre 2019). The largest portion of this is attributed to tropical cyclones (1,253 billion USD), followed by flooding (914 billion USD), earthquakes (757 billion USD) and drought (approximately 372 billion USD, or about 20 billion USD yr-1 losses) (Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre 2019). In the period  2017–2018,  natural  catastrophe  losses  total  approximately  219  billion  USD  (Bevere  2019). According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 14 weather and climate disasters cost 91 billion USD in 2018  (NOAA NCEI 2019). The European Environment Agency reports that ‘disasters caused by weather and climate-related extremes accounted for some 83% of the monetary losses over the period 1980–2017 for EU Member States (EU-28) and that weather and climate-related losses  amounted  to  426  billion  EUR.  For  the  EEA  member  countries  (EEA-33),  the  ‘total  reported economic losses caused by weather and climate-related extremes’ over the same period amounted to approximately  453  billion  EUR  (EEA  2019),  (EEA  2019).  Asia  Pacific    and  Oceania  has  been particularly impacted by typhoon and flooding (China, India, the Philippines) resulting in economic losses of 58 billion USD, 2000–2017, and combination of flooding typhoon and drought totalling 89 billion USD in 2018 (inclusive of loss by private insurers and government sponsored programs (Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre 2019). Based on past historical analysis, a region such as the Caribbean, which has experienced climate-related losses equal to 1% of GDP each year since 1960 is expected to have significant increases in such losses in the future leading to possible upwards of 8% of projected GDP in 2080 (Commonwealth Secretariat 2016). Similarly, Latin America countries, such as Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala, experienced severe losses in agriculture totalling about 6 billion USD due to drought in 2018 (Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre 2019). In the African region, where climate change is projected to get significantly warmer, continuing severe drought in parts of East Africa Tropical and Cyclone Idai, had devastating economic impacts.

According to Munich Re, loss from about 100 significant events in 2018 for Africa are estimated at 1.4 billion USD (Munich Re 2019). While there are questions about the sufficiency of insurance products to address the losses and damages of  climate-related  disasters,  insurance  can  help  to  cover  immediate  needs  directly,  provide  rapid response and transfer financial risk in times of extreme crisis (GIZ 2015; Lucas 2015; Schoenmaker and Zachmann 2015; Hermann et al. 2016; Wolfrom and Yokoi-Arai 2016; Kreft and Schäfer 2017; UNESCAP  2017;  Matias  et  al.  2018;  UNECA  2018;  Broberg  and  Hovani-Bue  2019;  EEA  2019; Martinez-diaz  et  al.  2019)  (high  confidence).  Commercial  insurability  is  heavily  driven  by  the predictability of losses and the resulting ability to calculate insurance premium levels properly. Climate change has become a major factor of increasing uncertainty. The previously strong reliance on historic data  in  calculation  of  premium  levels  may  be  but  a  starting  point  given  the  likely  need  for  upward adjustment  due  to  climate  change  and  potential  consequential  economic  damage.  Different  risk perceptions between policyholders and insurers will create contrary assessments on premium levels and consequently underinsurance. (McKinsey 2020b) also stresses the systemic effect of climate change on insurers' business models and resulting availability of appropriate insurance products. The  conventional  approach  to  such  protective  or  hedging  position  has  been  indemnity  and  other classical insurance micro, meso and macro level schemes (Hermann et al. 2016). These include micro insurance schemes such as index insurance and weather derivative approaches that cover individual’s specific needs such as coverage for farm crops. Meso level insurance schemes, which primarily benefit intermediary institutions, such as NGOs, credit union, financial institutions and farmer credit entities, seek to reduce losses caused by credit default thereby ‘enhancing investment potential’, whereas macro-level insurance schemes ‘allow both insured and uninsured individuals to be compensated for damages caused  by  extreme  weather  events’  (Hermann  et  al.  2016).  These  macro-level  insurance  include catastrophe bonds and weather derivatives etc. that transfer risk to capital market (Hermann et al. 2016). Over the last decades, there have been a trend towards weather-index insurance and other parametric insurance  products  based  on  predefined  pay-out  risk  pooling  instrument.  It  has  gained  favour  with governments in developing regions such as Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific because it provides certainty and predictability about funding - financial preparedness - for emergency actions and initial reconstruction and reduces moral hazard. This ‘financial resilience’ is also increasingly appealing to the business  sector,  particularly  MSMEs,  in  developing  countries  (MEFIN  Network  and  GI  RFPI  Asia 2016; Woods 2016; Schaer and Kuruppu 2018). To date, sovereign parametric climate risk pooling as a way of managing climate risk does not seem to have much traction in developed countries and does not appear to be attractive to actors in the G-20 countries.  No  G-20  members  are  yet  party  to  any  climate  risk  pooling  initiative  (Kreft  and  Schäfer 2017). However, international bilateral donors such as the USAID and the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development  Office  (FCDO,  formerly  DfID),  and  the  multilateral  development  banks,  are  all,  to different extent, supporters of the various climate risk pooling initiatives now operational in developing countries. As noted also in IPCC AR5, risk sharing and risk transfer strategies provide ‘pre-disaster financing arrangements that shift economic risk from one party to another’ (IPCC 2012). Risk pooling among countries and regions is relatively advantageous when compared to conventional insurance because of the effective subsidizing of ‘affected regions’ using revenues from unaffected regions which involve pooling among a large subset of countries (Lucas 2015) (high confidence). In general, the premiums are less costly than what an individual country or entity can achieve and disbursement is rapid and there are  also  fewer  transaction  costs(Lucas  2015;  World  Bank  2015).  The  World  Bank  argues  that  the experience  with  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Pilot  (PCRIP)  and  Africa  Risk  Capacity  risk pooling  (ARC)  show  saving  of  50%  in  obtaining  insurance  cover  for  pooled  risk  compared  with purchasing comparable coverage individually (Lucas 2015; World Bank 2015; ARC 2016).

At  the  same  time,  this  approach  has  substantial  basis  risk,  (actual  losses  do  not  equal  financial compensation) (Hermann et al. 2016) (high confidence). With parametric insurance, pay-out are pre-defined and based on risk modelling rather than on the ground damage assessment so may be less than, equal to, or greater than the actual damage. It does not cover actual losses and damage and therefore, may be insufficient to meet the cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction. It may also be ‘non-viable’ or damaging to livelihood in the long run (UNFCCC 2008; Hellmuth et al. 2009; Hermann et al. 2016). Additionally, if the required threshold is not met, there may be no pay-out, though a country may have experienced substantial damages from a climatic event. (This occurred for the Solomon Islands in 2014 which  discontinued  its  insurance  with the  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance  Pilot  when  neither its Santa Cruz earthquake nor the 2014 flash floods were eligible to receive a pay-out under the terms of the insurance (Lucas 2015). Increasingly, climate risk insurance scheme is being blended into disaster risk management as part of a comprehensive risk management approach (high confidence). The best-known example is the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF SPC 2018), which involves cooperation among Caribbean states, Japan, Canada, UK and France and international organizations such as World Bank (UNESCAP 2017). But there are growing platforms of such an approach mainly under the umbrella of the G7’s InsuResilience Initative (Deutsche Klimafinanzierung 2020), including, the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative) for the Pacific Islands, the African Risk Capacity (ARC Agency and its financial affiliate), and the African Risk Capacity Limited (ARC Ltd/ the ARC Group) (ARC 2016) and in the Asian region, the South East Asian Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF) and the  ASEAN  Disaster  Risk  Financing  and  Insurance  Program  (ADRFI),  (SEADRIF  2018;  GIZ  and World Bank 2019; Martinez-diaz et al. 2019; Vyas et al. 2019; World Bank 2019a). The group of 20 vulnerable  countries  (V-20)  has  also  developed  a  Sustainable  Insurance  Facility  (SIF),  billed  as technical assistance facility for climate-smart5 insurance for MSMEs in 48 developing countries as well as potentially to de-risk renewable energy in these countries and regions  (ACT Alliance 2020; V20 2020, 2021). However, as noted above, climate risk pooling is not a panacea. There are very obvious and significant challenges.  According  to  (Kreft  and  Schäfer  2017),  limitations  of  insurance  schemes,  include coordination  challenges,  limited  scope,  de-stabilization  due  to  exit  of  one  or  more  members  as premiums risk and inadequate attention to permanent (Schaeffer et al. 2014). There are also challenges with  risk  diversification,  replication,  and  scalability  (high  confidence).  For  example,  CCRIF  is extending  both  its  membership  and  diversifying  its  geographic  dimensions  into  Central  America  in seeking to lower covariate risk (similar shocks among cohorts such as droughts or floods). Under the SPC portfolio, CCRIF is able to segregate risk across the regions. Risk insurance does not obviate from the need to engage in capacity building to scale-up as well as having process for addressing systemic risk. Currently, risk pools have limited sectoral reach and may cover agriculture but not other important sectors such as fisheries and public utilities. Only recently (July 2019) has CCRIF initiated coverage of fisheries  with  the  development  of  its  he  Caribbean  Oceans  and  Aquaculture  Sustainability  Facility (COAST) instrument (CCRIF SPC 2019; ACT Alliance 2020). Historically, risk pool mechanisms, like FOOTNOTE5 According to the V20, ‘the term “climate-smart” captures the need for two types of climate-related insurance products for MSMEs in vulnerable economies: (1) Climate risk insurance (2) Insurance products which enable low carbon investments, and thereby contribute to increased efficiencies through cost-savings from cheaper low-carbon technologies (2021).

Since 2016, ARC has increased its scope to cover drought and in 2019 launched ARC Replica which not only covers drought but offers premiums and coverage to NGOs and the World Food Programme through the START Network and a pastoral drought product for protecting small farmers and ensuring food security. In some regions and countries, there may also be limited access to reinsurance (Schaeffer et al. 2014; Lucas 2015). An important down-side of climate risk pooling is that it does not cover the actual cost of damage and losses. Though on the positive side, pay-out may exceed costs, but it may also be less than cost. Hence, the parametric approach is not a panacea and does not preclude having recourse to conventional indemnity insurance, which  will  cover  full  damage  costs  after  a  climate  change  event  as  it  involves  full  on  the  ground assessment of factors such as the necessity and costs of repair versus say replacement value of damaged infrastructure. This may be important for governmental and publicly provided services such as schools, hospitals, roads, airports, communications equipment and water supply facilities. Given the growing popularity    of  parametric  insurance  and  climate  risk  pooling,  there  are  very  ambitious  attempts  to expand  this  approach  on  several  fronts  (Scherer  2017).  (Schoenmaker  and  Zachmann  2015)  have proposed a global climate risk pool to help the most vulnerable countries. The pathway to this includes capacity  building  in  underdeveloped  financing  sectors  of  developing  countries.  They  argue  that  as climate extreme become more normalised, they will wipe out significant part of the infrastructure and productive capacity of developing countries. This will have knock-on impact on fiscal capacity due to lowered tax revenue and high rebuilding costs. ‘Developing countries, (Schoenmaker and Zachmann 2015) argue, ‘cannot insure against such event on a market basis, nor would it be sensible to divert scare fiscal resources away from infrastructure investment into accumulating a financial buffer for such a situation (Schoenmaker and Zachmann 2015). In that context, (Schoenmaker and Zachmann 2015) call for international risk pooling as ‘the only sensible strategy’ especially if it addresses the major gaps in climate  risk  insurance  for  poor  and  vulnerable  communities  by  enhancing  demand  through  ‘smart support instrument’ for premium support such as full or partial  premium subsidies and investment in providing risk reduction (Schäfer et al. 2016; Le Quesne et al. 2017; MCII 2018; Vyas et al. 2019). This it is argued may help to smoothen out the limited uptake of regional institutions such as ARC, CCRIF SPC which are osnly in three regions of the world (with missing mechanism in South America). (Kreft and  Schäfer  2017).  Existing  regional  mechanisms,  while  they  may  perform  very  well,  only  cover  a portion  of  climatic  hazards  and  tend  to  have  limited  subscribers.  For  example,  across  the  key  four sovereign risk pools (ARC, CRIFSPC, PCRAFI and SEADRIF), though there are 68 countries only 1/3 or 32% have purchased coverage in 2019 and 46% ‘did not deploy disaster risk financing instruments (ACT Alliance 2020). Other gaps and challenges flagged by (Kreft and Schäfer 2017) include limited coverage of the full spectrum  of  contingency  risks  experienced  by  countries,  inadequate  role  of  risk  management  as  a standard for all regional pools, though there are some emerging best practices in terms of data provision on weather-related risks, and incentivization of risk reduction (high confidence). Here, they recognise the  work  of  ARC’s  Africa  Risk  Capacity  for  not  only  providing  the  infrastructure  to  trigger disbursement but for also promoting national risk analysis. Another important gap in the landscape of climate risk pooling is lack of attention to financial institutions’ lending portfolio that is vulnerable to weather shocks. In this regard  subsidies as part of innovative financing schemes facilitated by the donor community can encourage the uptake of meso-level climate risk insurance solutions (Kreft and Schäfer 2017).  In  the  literature,  there  are  two  attempts  at  systematic  evaluation  or  comprehensive  assessment  of regional climate risk pools. A comprehensive study by (Scherer 2017) and FCDO ten-year evaluation (2015-2024).  Overall,  none  of  these  studies  draw  adverse  conclusions  about  regional  climate  risk pooling initiatives/mechanisms. According to Scherer ‘it appears that insurances work in principle and there  is  certainly  successes’  and  ’initial  experiences  demonstrate  regional  climate  risk  insurances works’.

The FCDO study examines the uptake of ARC and its impact on reducing vulnerability to disasters. It notes that there is scarce literature on disaster risk insurance mechanism in terms of impacts. In its current sample of 20 countries as of November 2017, 4 are projected to experience food security crisis (IPC Level 3) but are not signatories to the ARC which may signal that ARC is not attractive to all food insecure countries and that there is no overwhelming appetite for ARC among poorer countries. Additionally, (Panda and Surminski 2020), research on the importance of indicators and frameworks for monitoring the performance and impact of CDRI make no final assessment of any of the regional climate risk pool. However, they propose mechanisms to improve the transparency and accountability of the system. Both (Scherer 2017), (Forest 2018) and (Panda and Surminski 2020), seems to indicate that ‘there is enthusiasm to support and scale up regional climate risk insurance’ (Scherer 2017, p. 4) Examples of this support include, the Germany Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has provided 5.9 million USD for WFP to protect 1.2 million vulnerable African framers with climate risk insurance, through ARC Replica, and  the  G7,  InsuResilience  Vision  2025,  which  has    committed  to  ensuring  400–500  million  poor persons are covered against disaster shock by pre-arranged finance and insurance mechanism by 2025, some of this will be through ARC (WFP 2020). Of course, this does not mean that risk pools are without challenges or are not failing on specific sets of metrics. (Forest 2018) flags three failings areas: policy holder and hazard coverage, the cost of premium and risk transfer parameters and the use of pay-out, which in most cases are up to the government. Here, ARC is flagged among the three regional Risk pools, as the only one with contingency plan requirement that can support effective use of pay-outs. Other research exploring climate risk pool and its impacts, flag lack of transparency around pay-out, premium or risk transfer parameters. Ultimately, climate risk pools are not full insurance; they offer only limited coverage. Entities such as the UK Anti-Corruption Help desk is exploring how to mitigate potential corruption with regard to climate risk insurance. 15.6.5  Widen the focus of relevant actors: Role of communities, cities and sub-national levels  There is an urgency and demand to meet the financial needs of the climate change actions not only at the national level but also at the subnational level, to achieve low-carbon and climate-resilient cities and communities (Barnard 2015; Moro et al. 2018) (high confidence). Scaling up subnational climate finance and investment is a necessary condition to achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation action (Ahmad et al. 2019).  The  importance  of  exploring effective  subnational  climate  finance.  Stronger  subnational  climate action  is  indispensable  to  adapt  cities  to  build  more  sustainable,  climate-positive  communities (Kuramochi et al. 2020). It has transformative potential as a key enabler of inclusive urban economic development through the building of resilient communities (Floater et al. 2017a; Colenbrander et al. 2018b;  Ahmad  et  al.  2019)  (high  confidence).  Yet  the  significant  potential  of  subnational  climate finance mechanisms remains unfulfilled. Policy frameworks, governance, and choices at higher levels underpin subnational climate investments  (Colenbrander et al. 2018b; Hadfield and Cook 2019). To scale climate investment, a systematical understanding of the preconditions to mobilizing high-potential financing instruments at the national and subnational levels is necessary.  Subnational  climate  finance  needs  and  flows.  Subnational  climate  finance  covers  financing mechanisms reaching or utilizing subnational actors to develop climate positive investment in urban areas.  The  fragility  of  interconnected  national  and  subnational  finances  affects  subnational  finance flows, including the impact of the social-economic crisis (Canuto and Liu 2010; Ahrend et al. 2013). The effect of deficit in investment for global infrastructure towards the growing subnational-level debt also creates pressure on subnational finances and constrains future access to financing (Smoke 2019) (high confidence).

However, State of Cities Climate Finance report estimated that  an  average  of  USD  384  billion  was  invested  in  urban  climate  finance  annually  in  2017-2018 (Negreiros et al. 2021). The Institute for Environment and Development estimates that out of the 17.4 billion USD total investments in climate finance, less than 10% (1.5 billion USD) was approved for locally-focused climate change projects between 2003 and 2016 (Soanes et al. 2017).  Subnational climate public and private finance. Urban climate finance and investment are prominent among  the  subnational  climate  finance  landscape  (CCFLA  2015;  Buchner  et  al.  2019).  Finance mechanisms that can support climate investment for the urban sector include public-private partnerships (PPPs); international finance; national investment vehicles; pricing, regulation, standards; land value capture; debt finance; and fiscal decentralization (Granoff et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017b; Gorelick 2018; White and Wahba 2019). Among these mechanisms, PPPs, debt finance, and land value capture have the potentials to mobilise private finance (Ahmad et al. 2019). Better standardization in processes is needed, including those bearing on contracts and regulatory arrangement, to reflect local specificities (Bayliss and Van Waeyenberge 2018) [Reference to Public private mobilization Section in 15.6.1.1]. PPPs  are  particularly important in cities  with mature financial  systems  as  the effectiveness  of  PPPs depends on appropriate investment architecture at scale and government capacity  (high confidence). Such cities can enable its infrastructure such as renewable energy production and distribution, water networks, and  building  developments  to  generate  consumer  revenue  streams that incentivise  private investors to purchase equity as a long-term investment (Floater et al. 2017b).  National-level investment vehicles can provide leadership for subnational climate financing and crowd in private finance by providing early-stage market support to technologies or evidence related to asset performance  and  costs-benefits  (high  confidence).  The  use  of  carbon  pricing  is  increasing  at  the subnational level along with regulation and standards on negative externalities, such as pollution, to steer investment towards climate financing (World BankGroup 2019).  Debt financing via subnational bonds and borrowing, including municipal bonds, is another potential tool for raising upfront capital, especially for rich cities (high confidence). The share of sub-national, sub-sovereign, and sovereign bonds could grow over time, given efforts to expand the creditworthiness and ensure a sufficient supply of own-source revenue to reduce the default risk. As of now, subnational and  sub-sovereign  bonds  are  constrained  by  public  finance  limits  and  the  fiscal  capacities  of governments. However, while green bonds have potential for growth at the subnational level and may result in a lower cost of capital in some cases, the market faces challenges related to scaling up and has been associated with limited measurable environmental impact to date (see Section 15.6.8 Innovative Financial Products for further discussion). Further, bonds with lower credit ratings drive higher issuance costs for climate risk cities, e.g., costs related to disclosure and reporting (Painter 2020).  Key challenges of subnational climate finance. Across all types of cities, five key challenges constrain the flow of subnational climate finance (high confidence): (i) difficulties in mobilizing and scaling-up private financing (Granoff et al. 2016); (ii) deficient existing architecture in providing investment on the scale and with the characteristics needed (Anguelovski and Carmin 2011; Brugmann 2012); (iii) political-economic  uncertainties,  primarily  related  to  innovation  and  lock-in  barriers  that  increase investment  risks  (Unruh  2002;  Cook  and  Chu  2018;  White  and  Wahba  2019));  (iv)  the  deficit  in investment for global infrastructure affects the growing subnational-level debt (Canuto and Liu 2010) and; (v) insufficient positive value capture (Foxon et al. 2015).  Different finance challenges between rich and poor cities.

Different challenges accessing capital markets associated with wealthy and poorer cities are compounded into three main issues: (i) scarcity and access of financial resources (Bahl and Linn 2014; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; Cook and Chu 2018; Gorelick 2018), (ii) the level of implication  from  the  existing  distributional  uncertainties  to  the  current  financing  of  infrastructural decarbonization across carbon markets (Silver 2015), and (iii) the policy and jurisdictional ambiguity in urban public finance institutions (Padigala and Kraleti 2014; Cook and Chu 2018). In poorer cities, these differing features continue to be inhibited by contextual characteristics of subnational finance, including gaps in domestic and foreign capital (Meltzer 2016), the mismatch between investment needs and  available  finance  (Gorelick  2018),  weak  financial  autonomy,  insufficient  financial  maturity, investment-grade credit ratings in local debt markets (Bahl and Linn 2014), scarce diversified funding sources and stakeholders (Gorelick 2018; Zhan et al. 2018; Zhan and de Jong 2018) and weak enabling environments (Granoff et al. 2016). The depth and character of the local capital market also affect cities differently in generating bonds (high  confidence).  Challenges  facing  cities  in  developing  countries  include  insufficient  appropriate institutional arrangements, the issues of minimum size, and high transaction costs associated with green bonds (Banga 2019). Green projects and project pipelines are generally smaller in scale feasible for a bond market transaction (Saha and D’Almeida 2017; DFID 2020). De-risking in the different phases of long-term  project  financing  can  be  promoted  to  improve  appetite  of  capital  market  [Reference  to development of local capital markets Section in 15.6.7]. Climate investment and finance for communities. There is insufficient evidence that which financing schemes contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptations at community level (high confidence). There is growing interest in the linkages between microfinance and adaptation on the agriculture sector (Agrawala and Carraro 2010; Fenton et al. 2015; Chirambo 2016; CIF 2018; Dowla 2018), the finance for  community-based  adaptation  actions  (Fenton  et  al.  2014;  Sharma  et  al.  2014),  and  the  relations between remittances and adaptation (Le De et al. 2013). However, there is less discussion on community finance  aside  from  the  benefits  of  community  finance  and  village  funds  in  contributing  to  close investment gaps and community-based mitigation in the renewable energy and forest sectors  (Ebers Broughel and Hampl 2018; Bauwens 2019; Watts et al. 2019) The full potential and barriers of the community finance model are still unknown and research needs to expand understanding of favourable policy environments for community finance (Bauwens 2019; Watts et al. 2019).  Implications for the transformation pathway.  Cities often have capacity constraints on planning and preparing capital investment plans. An integrated urban  capital  investment  planning  is  an  option  to  develop  cross-sectoral  solutions  that  reduce investment  needs,  boost  coordination  capacity,  and  increase  climate-smart  impacts  (Negreiros  et  al. 2021) (high confidence). In countries with weak and poorly functioning intergovernmental systems, alliances  and  networks  may  influence  their  organizational  ability  to  translate  adaptive  capacity  for transformation  into  actions  (Leck  and  Roberts  2015;  Colenbrander  et  al.  2018a).  Deepening understanding of country-specific enabling environment for mobilizing urban climate finance among and  within  cities  and  communities,  design  of  policy,  institutional  practices  and  intergovernmental systems are needed to reduce negative implications of transformation (Steele et al. 2015).  15.6.6  Innovative financial products  Innovative  financial  products  with  increased  transparency  on  climate  risk  have  attracted  investor demand,  and  can  facilitate  investor  identification  of  low  carbon  investments  (high  confidence). Innovative products may not necessarily increase financial flows for climate solutions in the near term, however  they  can  help  build  capacity  on  climate  risk  and  opportunities  within  institutions  and companies to pave the way for increased flows over time.

Since AR5, innovative financial products such as sustainability and green labelled financial products have proliferated (see financial stock estimates in Section 0). These financial products are not necessarily ‘new’  in  terms  of  financial  design  but  are  packaged  or  labelled  in  an  innovative  way  to  attract responsible and impact-oriented institutional investors.  The growth and diversity of the green bond market illustrates how innovative financial  products can attract both public and private investors (high confidence). Demand for green financial products initially stemmed from public sector pension funds. Pension funds and insurance companies in OECD countries have traditionally favoured bonds as an asset class with lower risk (OECD and Bloomberg 2015).  Since AR5, labelled green bonds have grown significantly, exceeding 290 billion USD issued in 2020  with a total of 1.1 trillion USD in outstanding bonds (CBI 2021a) (see also local capital markets Section 15.6.7).  Corporates,  financial  institutions  and  government-backed  entities  (e.g.  in  real  estate,  retail, manufacturing, energy utilities) issued the largest volumes, with use of proceeds focused primarily on GHG mitigation in energy, buildings and transport projects (CBI 2021a). Given their focus on GHG mitigation,  green  bonds  are  also  sometimes  referred  to  as  climate  bonds,  but  the  common  market terminology is ‘green’. Municipal green bond issuance has also been growing (see further discussion on municipal green bonds in Section 15.6.7 on local actors). Beyond green bonds, additional products such as green loans, green commercial paper, green initial public offerings (IPOs), green commodities, and sustainability-linked bonds and loans have also been introduced in the market (CBI 2019a) (see discussion on building yield curves in local capital markets Section 15.6.7).  Investor demand for green bonds is evidenced by over-subscription of deals. Recent studies indicate an over-subscription for green labelled bonds by an average of between three and five times, as compared to non-labelled bonds (Gore and Berrospi 2019; Nauman 2020). Results of a survey of global treasurers showed a higher demand for green bonds than non-labelled bonds for 70% of the respondents (CBI 2020a). The financial crisis associated with COVID-19 has put increased pressure on debt issuers, and the extent to  which  the  increase  in  indebtedness  for  sovereigns  and  corporates  has  been  financed  via  climate-related labelled debt products is not known. Further, at this time there is no identified literature assessing the  degree  to  which  international  versus  domestic  investors  are  financing  sovereign  green  debt  in developing  countries  (for  further  discussion  on  attracting  different  types  of  investors  through  the development of local capital markets Section 15.6.7) However, since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, continued steady growth in issuance has been observed broadly across sustainable bonds (including green,  social  and  sustainability  bonds),  with more  significant  growth  in  social  bonds  to  support  the COVID-19 recovery (Maltais and Nykvist 2020; CBI 2021a).  Index  providers  and  exchanges  can  also  play  a  supporting  role  in  transparency  for  identification  of benchmarks and innovative financial products for climate action. Low-carbon indices have proliferated in recent years, with varying approaches including reduced exposure to fossil, best-in-class performers within a sector, and fossil-free (UN PRI 2018) (see discussion on ESG index performance that follows in this section). Indices can provide transparency on low-carbon opportunities making it simpler for funds and investors to identify green investment options. Exchanges can also play a supporting role to the  uptake  of  green  financial  products  through  transparent  listings  and  requirements  to  improve credibility of green labelling. The number of green or sustainability bond listing segments tripled from five in 2016 to 15 in 2018 (SSE 2018). Green security listings can also be used to enhance local capital markets (see Section 15.6.7 for further discussion). Significant potential exists for continued growth in innovative financial products, though some challenges  remain  (high  confidence).  Despite  recent  growth  and  diversification,  green  bonds  face several challenges in scaling up.

Yet there remain several challenges to growing the green bond market, including inter alia concerns about greenwashing and limitations in application to developing countries (Shishlov et al. 2018; Banga 2019). There  is  no  globally  accepted  definition  of  green  bonds,  and  varied  definitions  of  eligible  green activities  are  evolving  across  regional  bond  markets. Beyond  the  most  commonly  used  green label, other related labels such as blue, sustainable, transition, sustainable development goal (SDG), social and  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  have  some  overlapping  applications  (Schumacher 2020). The degree to which these labels represent climate relevant investments depend on underlying criteria and how they are applied (see also discussion in local capital markets Section 15.6.4).  There are several initiatives aimed at protecting the integrity of the green label. Guidance on use and management of proceeds established by the International Capital Markets Association’s Green Bond Principles (GBP) is followed on a voluntary basis, which notes eligible use of proceeds as primarily climate mitigation and adaptation projects. The GBP also recommend independent external reviews at the  time  of  issuance,  with  89%  of  green  bond  issuers  in  2020  with  external  reviews  at  the  time  of issuance (CBI 2021a). In addition to best practice based on voluntary principles, a further check on greenwashing, although insufficient on its own, is the fear of reputation risk on behalf of investors, issuers and intermediaries in the age of social media (Hoepner et al. 2017; Deschryver and de Mariz 2020). A report on post-issuance green bond impact reporting notes that despite concerns (Shishlov et al. 2018), greenwashing incidence is rare, with 77% of green bond issuers reporting on allocation and 59% reporting on impact, but with significant variance in quality and consistency of impact reporting  (CBI 2021b).  Financial disclosure regulatory developments can help further align and specify definitions of green in the financial sector but are not a substitute for climate policy (high confidence). Developing a common basis for understanding a green label could further reduce uncertainty or concerns of greenwashing. Regulatory  developments  in  some  regions  seek  to  further  guard  against  greenwashing  with  more specific definitions. The EU sustainable finance package, including the EU Taxonomy and EU Green Bond Standard draft regulations, is the broadest reaching, but not the only, regional initiative focused on  disclosure  of  climate  risk  (see  also  Section  15.6.3).  Taxonomies  across  regions  are  not  always aligned  on  what  can  constitute  a  green  project,  for  example  with  respect  to  transition  activities (International Capital Market Association 2021) (see also discussion on local capital markets in Section 15.6.7). While standardisation can help reduce uncertainty in markets with imperfect knowledge, the green bond market is currently developing and is expected to continue to reflect regional differences in economic governance approaches (Nedopil et al. 2021). Regulations may also have trade-offs in terms of  transaction  costs  for  green  financial  product  issuers.  Classification  approaches  can  also  face challenges, depending on how they are designed, in their ability to capture new technologies and social impacts (see Section 15.4).  Green bonds have been primarily targeting climate mitigation projects, with far fewer projects identified as adaptation. Green bonds mainly finance projects in the energy, buildings and transportation sectors, which constituted 85% of the use of proceeds of green bonds in 2020 (CBI 2020b, 2021a). Agriculture and  forestry  projects,  including  adaptation  projects,  have  been  less  suited  to  be  financed  in  a  bond structure, which could be in part due to the more dispersed and smaller nature of the projects and in part due to project ‘bankability’ or ability to contribute steady streams of financing to pay back the terms of a  bond.  However,  adaptation  projects  may  not  be  identified  as  such  as  resiliency  becomes  more mainstreamed into infrastructure planning (see Section 15.3.2) While green bonds have the potential to further support financial flows to developing countries, local capital markets can be at varying stages of development (see discussion in Section  15.6.2 on enabling Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-74  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 environments and in Section 15.6.7 on local capital markets for peer-learning examples and de-risking opportunities)  (Banga  2019).  While  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  finance  institutions  have been active in the green bond market, global issuance in 2020 in the top 10 countries included only one developing  country  (CBI  2021a).  Targeting  international  investors  can  be  enhanced  via  de-risking activities (see further discussion in section 15.6.4).  Identifying green financial products can increase uptake and may result in a lower cost of capital in certain parts of the market (high confidence). Investors face a systematic under-pricing of climate risk in financial markets (Krogstrup and Oman 2019; Kumar et al. 2019). Transparent identification of financial products can make it easier for investors to include low carbon products in their portfolios. Investors with mandates that include or are focused on climate change are showing an interest in green-labelled financial products. Investors that identify themselves as green constitute approximately 53% of the investor base for green bonds in the first half of 2019 (CBI 2019b).  There is some evidence of a premium, or an acceptance of lower yields by the investor, for green bonds (medium confidence). A survey of recent literature finds some  consensus of the existence of a green premium in 56% of the studies on the primary markets (with a wide variance of premium amount), and 70%  of  the  studies  on  the  secondary  market  (with  an  average  premium  of  -1  to  -9  basis  points), particularly for government issued, investment grade and green bonds that follow defined governance and reporting practices (MacAskill et al. 2021). In the US municipal bond market, as credit quality for green labelled bonds has increased in the past few years, some studies show a positive premium for green bonds is arising (Baker et al. 2018; Karpf and Mandel 2018), or appearing only in the secondary market (Partridge and Medda 2020), while others find no evidence of a premium (Hyun et al. 2019; Larcker  and  Watts  2020).  Several  studies  also  show  a  recent  emergence  of  a  premium  and oversubscription for some green labelled bonds denominated in EUR (CBI 2019b), in some cases for both USD or EUR (Ehlers and Packer 2017) green bonds, with a wide variation in the range of the observed  difference  in  basis  points  focusing  on  the  secondary  market  (Gianfrate  and  Peri  2019; Nanayakkara and Colombage 2019; Zerbib 2019), with financial institution and corporate green bonds exhibiting a marginal premium compared with their non-green comparisons (Hachenberg and Schiereck 2018; Kempa et al. 2021). Spill over effects of green bonds may also impact equity markets and other financing conditions. Stock prices have been shown to positively respond to green bond issuance (Tang and Zhang 2020). One study linked enhanced credit quality induced by issuing green labelled bonds to a lower cost of capital for corporate issuers (Agliardi and Agliardi 2019). Issuers’ reputation and use of third-party verification can also improve financing conditions for green bonds (Bachelet et al. 2019). Green bonds are strongly dependent on fixed income market movements and are impacted by significant price spill over from the corporate and treasury bond markets (Reboredo 2018). A simulation of future green sovereign bond issuances  shows  that  this  can  promote  green  finance  via  firm’s  expectations  and  the  credit  market (Monasterolo and Raberto 2018). Financial  flows  via  these  instruments  have  limited  measurable  environmental  impact  to  date, however they can support capacity building on climate risk and opportunities within institutions to  realise  future  impacts  (high  confidence).  There  is  a  lack  of  evidence  to  date  that  green  and sustainable  financial  products  have  significant  impacts  in  terms  of  climate  change  mitigation  and adaptation (see also Box 15.7). Further, new products must be coupled with tightened  climate policy and a reduction in investments associated with GHG-emitting activities to make a difference on the climate (see section 15.3.3.2 for further discussion on reduction of financial flows to emitting activities). It is challenging to link specific emission reductions with specific instruments that mainly target climate activities  such  as  green  bonds.  Data  challenges  point  to  an  inability  to  link  emission  reductions, including Scope 3 GHG emissions, at the organization or firm level with green bond use-of-proceeds Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-75  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 issuance (Ehlers et al. 2020; Tuhkanen and Vulturius 2020). However  one study found evidence of a signalling effect of issuing green bonds resulting in emission reductions at the corporate level following issuance (Flammer 2020), and another study characterised the lifecycle emissions of renewable energy financed by green bonds, indicating potentially substantive avoided emissions but with variance up to a factor of 12 across bonds depending on underlying assumptions (Gibon et al. 2020). There is also a lack of impact reporting requirements and consistency in the green bond market. Impact reporting is not typically required for green bond listings on specific exchanges, nor are there any requirements for independent  reviews  of  impact  reporting,  however  this  could  change  in  future  if  investors  apply pressure.  Green-labelled  products  may  not  necessarily  result  in  increased  financial  flows  to  climate  projects, although there can be benefits from capacity building with issuing institutions. Green bonds can be used to finance new climate projects or refinance existing climate projects, and thus do not necessarily result in finance for new climate projects constituting additional GHG reductions (a framing used in the Clean Development Mechanism). The labelling process itself may not necessarily lead to additional financing (Dupre et al. 2018;  Nicol et  al.  2018b).  However, the  labelling  process  has  merit  in contributing to building  capacity  within  issuing  institutions  on  climate  change  (Schneeweiss  2019),  which  could support identification of new green projects in the pipeline.  Climate risk disclosure initiatives, some of which are voluntary in nature, may have a limited direct climate  impact.  Transparency  on  climate  risk  may  not  change  investor  decisions  nor  result  in divestment, especially in the emerging economies, as support and clear direction from regulatory and policy mechanisms are required to drive institutional investors at large  (Ameli et al. 2021c). On the other  hand,  there  is  evidence  of  reduced  fossil  fuel  investments  following  mandatory  climate  risk disclosure requirements, indicating a broader signalling effect of transparency (Mésonnier and Nguyen 2021).   *** START BOX 15.7. HERE *** Box 15.7 Impact of ESG and sustainable finance products and strategies  While  scaling  up  climate  finance  remains  a  challenge  (see  Section  15.3.2),  there  is  consensus  that investments  that  are  managed  taking  into  account  broader  sustainability  criteria  have  increased consistently and ESG integration into sustainable investment is increasingly being mainstreamed by the financial  sector  over the  last  years  (Maiti  2021).  The  United  Nations  Principles  for  Responsible Investment (PRI) grew to over 3000 signatories in 2020, representing over USD 100 trillion in assets under  management  (UN  PRI  2020).  And  according  to  the  2018  biennial  assessment  by  Global Sustainable Investment Alliance6, sustainable investments in five major developed economies grew by 34% in the two year period following the 2016 assessment. The primary ESG approaches leveraged were  exclusion  criteria  and  ESG  integration,  which  together  amounted  to  over  USD  37  trillion, accounting for two-thirds of the assessed sustainable investments, with novel strategies such as best-in class screening and sustainability themed investing showing significant growth, although together they accounted for around 6 percent of these investments (GSIA 2019). Shareholder activism or corporate engagement is the other key approach, which has been well established and continued to grow to nearly USD 10 trillion (GSIA 2019).  However,  research  indicates  that  ESG  strategies  by  themselves,  do  not  yield  meaningful  social  or environmental outcomes (Kölbel et al. 2020). When it comes to the tangible impact of the financial sector on addressing climate change and sustainable development, there remains ambiguity. There is a growing need for more robust assessment of ESG scores, including establishing higher standardization FOOTNOTE6 GSIA is an international collaboration of membership-based sustainable investment organizations.

The issue was highlighted in an assessment of six of the leading ESG rating  agencies’  company  ratings  under  the  MIT  Aggregate  Confusion  Project,  which  found  the correlation among them to be 0.61, leading them to conclude that available ESG data was “noisy and unreliable” (Berg et al. 2020). This need is reaffirmed by (Drempetic et al. 2020), who claim that a thorough investigation of ESG scores remains a relatively neglected topic, with extraneous factors, such as firm size, influencing the score (Drempetic et al. 2020). There continues to be a research gap in assessing the direct impact of ESG and sustainable investments on climate change indicators, with most existing studies assessing  the co-relation between either the factors driving the sustainable finance trends and the impact on sustainable investments, or sustainable investments  and  the  impact  on  corporate  financial  performance.  Nevertheless,  since  the  post  SDG adoption period, there has been a notable uptake on research linking sustainable business practices and financial performance (Muhmad and Muhamad 2020a). This research shows that there is a growing business  case  for  ESG  investing,  with  evidence  increasingly  indicating  a  non-negative  co-relation between ESG, SDG adoption and corporate financial performance  (Friede et al. 2015; Muhmad and Muhamad 2020b), and ESG performance having a positive relation with stock returns (Consolandi et al. 2020). Research, focused on developed economies, also indicates towards a positive relation between ESG criteria and disclosure, and economic sustainability of a firm (Giese et al. 2019; Alsayegh et al. 2020)  and  allays  investor  fears  by  showing  that  sustainable  finance  initiatives,  such  as  divestment, doesn’t adversely impact investment portfolio performance (Henriques and Sadorsky 2018; Trinks et al. 2018). It should be reiterated, that this research assesses the co-relation between ESG criteria and corporate  financial  performance,  with  the  researchers  in  some  cases,  such  as  (Friede  et  al.  2015), including  disclaimers  of  the  results  being  inconclusive  and  highlighting  the  need  for  a  deeper assessment for linking ESG criteria with impact on financial performance.  On the other hand, there is growing evidence for a sustainable investment lens having a broader positive impact  on  creating  an  enabling  environment  and  strengthening  the  case  for  such  investments.  For instance, CSR activities and investments on the environment dimension, specifically in the areas of emission and resource reduction, were found to be profitable and a predictor of future abnormal returns in the longer term, from additional cash flow and additional demand (Dorfleitner et al. 2018). These factors could be contributing to the increasing trend of sustainable and green investments, and can said to be further reiterated by the spate of investor led collaborative initiatives and recent announcements by leading finance institutes in the developed economies, which is well recorded in a range of recent grey  literature,  including  new  climate-aligned  investment  strategies  and  ambition  towards  net  zero targets.  Yet there is also a risk of companies announcing projected sustainability or net zero targets and claiming the associated positive reputational impact, while having no clear action plan in place to achieve these. The lack of mandatory reporting frameworks, which results in an over-reliance on self-reported carbon data by companies for ESG assessments, can be a primary contributor (In and Schumacher 2021).  While there is a lack of research on the impact of sustainable finance products, divestment impact has been  assessed  in  more  detail.  Although  the  research  here  also  points  towards  the  ambiguous  direct impact  of  divestment  on  reducing  GHG  emissions  or  on  the  financial  performance  of  fossil  fuel companies, its indirect impact on framing the narrative around sustainable finance decisions (Bergman 2018), and the inherent potential of the divestment movement for building awareness and mobilizing broader  public  support  for  effective climate  policies,  have  been  better  researched  and  could  be considered to be the more relevant outcomes (Braungardt et al. 2019). Arguments against divestment point  to  its  largely  symbolic  nature,  but  (Braungardt  et  al.  2019)  elaborate  on  the  broader  positive impacts  of  divestment,  which  includes  its  ability  to  spur  climate  action  as  a  moral  imperative  and stigmatise and reduce the power of the fossil fuel lobby, and the potential of the approach to mitigate Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-77  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII systemic financial risks arising due to climate change and address the legal responsibilities of investors merging in this regard.  Challenges  remain  with  regards  to  overlapping  definitions  of  sustainable  and  ESG  investment opportunities, which also vary depending on social norms and pathways. There is also a general need for more extensive ESG disclosure on a corporate level, against the background of emerging mandatory impact  reporting  for  asset  managers  in  some  regions.  A  movement  is  building  towards  sustainable investment strategies and increased sustainable development awareness in the financial sector (Maiti 2021; Muhmad and Muhamad 2020b), which points to the ability of civil society movements, such as divestment  campaigns,  to  have  some  influence  on  investor  behaviour,  although  there  are  other influences such as climate risk disclosure initiatives and regulations.  *** END BOX 15.7. HERE *** 15.6.7  Development of local capital markets  International Situational Context. Developing countries make up two thirds of the world population, carry carbon intensive economies where 70% of investments need to be conducted to limit warming to 2°C. The focus for climate investments has been on China, USA, Europe, India and the G-20 (UNEP 2019)  but  studies  highlight  Paris  and  SDG  attention  should  be  devoted  to  Africa, LDCs  and  SIDS (Africa Union Commission 2015; GCA-AAI 2020; Feindouno et al. 2020; Warner 2020; AOSIS 2021). The “special needs, circumstances and vulnerability” of Africa, LDC and SIDS nations are recognised under UNFCCC and UN agreements (UN 2009, 2015a,b,c; UNFCCC 2010, 2015; Pauw et al. 2019). These  nations  currently  contribute  very  little  to  global  emissions.  Developing  countries  with  their growing economies, including the vast Africa continent roughly the size of China, Europe, USA, India combined  (IEA 2014b, p. 20) with a 1 billion population expected to double by 2050, growing reliance on  fossil  fuels  and  ‘cheap’  biomass  (charcoal  use  and  deforestation)  amid  rising  urbanization  and industrialisation  ambitions  –  collectively  these  nations  hold  large  leap-frog  potential  for  the  energy transition as well as risks of infrastructure lock-in. Accelerated international cooperation is a critical enabler  (IPCC  2018)  in  recognising  this  potential.  This  could  mobilise  global  savings,  scale  up development of local capital markets for accelerated low carbon investment and adaptation in low and lower middle income countries as well as tackle illicit finance including tax avoidance leakages that deprive developing countries of valuable resources (US DoJ 2009; Hearson 2014; Hanlon 2017a; US DoJ  2019;  UN  IATFD  2021).  Diversifying  funding  sources  is  important  at  a  time  hard-currency Eurobond  issuances  reach  records  (Panizza  and  Taddei  2020;  Moody’s  Investors  Service  2021). Otherwise,  the  structure  of  voluntary,  nationally  oriented,  and  financially  fragmented  arrangements under the Paris Agreement (see Chapter 17) could lead to ‘regional rivalry’ (SSP 3) pathways (IPCC 2018; Gazzotti et al. 2021). The benefits are many times greater than apparent costs in terms of expected decline  in  global  GHG  emissions  and  attaining  SDGs.  These  could  even  generate  large  ‘win-win’ opportunities back in capital source countries which will benefit from a flow back in import demand (Hourcade et al. 2021a). Lessons from literature on policy options in mobilising capital for Paris and SDGs in developing countries can be summarised as:  a) development of national just transition strategies i) meet the 100 billion USD commitment on a grant-equivalent basis to support NDCs that integrate policies on COVID-19 recovery, climate action, sustainable development and equity b)  increase the leverage of public funds on diverse sources of private capital through de-risking investments and public private partnerships involving location-based entities with AAA rated players and institutional investors c) co-ordination of project preparation and development of project pipelines by infrastructure co-ordinator agencies, one-stop structuring and financing shops, project risk facilities provided by cities development banks,  green  banks,  world  climate  bank,  global  guarantee  mechanism,  and  global  infrastructure Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-78  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 investment platform d) development of local currency bond markets backed-by cross-border guarantees, technical  assistance,  remediation  assets especially  by regional  and  national players  whose mandates include nurturing local capital markets to support bond yield curve development and exchange listing options e) adopting advances in science-based assessment methods to foster accountability i) for project assessment, MRV and certification ii) for disclosures in climate, fossil fuels, SDG, debt transparency and debt sustainability iii) for progress on UN systems of national accounts particularly for public sector finance statistics. Whole of society approach to mobilising diverse capital. There’s no shortage of money globally: it is simply that it has yet to travel to where it’s most needed. One challenge is unlocking unencumbered endowments to contribute to Paris and SDGs. (high confidence). The aggregate global wealth figures exceed 200 trillion USD (Davies et al. 2016; UBS 2017; Credit Suisse 2020; Heredia et al. 2020). Some developing countries have run pilots for investing in government bonds capitalising on fintech growth discussed  in  section  15.6.6  (The  Economist  2017;  Akwagyiram  and  Ohuocha  2021).  Others  are developing  green  products  to  encourage  uptake  by  middle  class  retail  investors  (Eurosif  2018;  HM Treasury  and  UK  DMO  2021).  Millennial-aged  inheritors  expected  to  receive  intergenerational transfers mobilized by global citizen activism (see Chapter 2) invest in green retail and tech products (UBS 2017; Capgemini 2021; Morgan Stanley 2017). Historic inequity and diaspora-related private and public  resources  pledged  and  debated  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  might  have  potential  to contribute  towards  Paris  and  SDGs  (Olusoga  2015;  Glueck  and  Friedman  2020;  Hall  2020;  Piketty 2020;  Timsit  2020;  Goldman  Sachs  2021;  Guthrie  2021;  Mieu  2021;  Wagner  2021).  Philanthropic institutions  use  grants,  debt,  equity,  guarantees  and  issue  investment  grade  bonds  in  using unencumbered endowments (Manilla 2018; Covington 2020; Moody’s 2020) but only about 2% of their resources are dedicated to climate action (Williams 2015b; Kramer 2017; Morena 2018; Delanoë et al. 2021). The pandemic exemplified the unprecedented collaboration and mobilisation of multilateral and scientific communities supported by the COVAX risk sharing mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines with pooling  of  financial  and  scientific  resources  (OECD  2021d).  This  momentum  in  international cooperation can be harnessed to galvanise resources including for teaching of sciences in developing countries  important  in  tackling  society  challenges,  alleviating  poverty  (TWAS  2021)  and  inequity legacies compounded by climate impacts debated by many (Henochsberg 2016; Obregon 2018; The Economist  2021;  Fernandez  et  al.  2021).  Suggestions  towards  equitable  models  include  “global adaptation funding approaches” (Chancel and Piketty 2015), a “world climate bank” to finance climate investments through long term  bonds  (Foley  2009;  Broome  2012;  Broome  and Foley  2016),  “cities development bank” (Alexander et al. 2019) , “public debt financing models” (Rendall 2021) to share the burden between generations which has precedence in history (Draper 2007; Fowler 2015).  Local financial institutions with local markets knowledge could benefit from technical assistance and partnership to scale up their potential. Institutional investors could be better mobilised (high confidence). The Global South has some 260 public development banks/PDBs representing 5 trillion USD in assets with a worldwide PDB capacity to provide more than 400 billion USD  yr-1 of climate finance  (IDFC  and  GCF  2020).  Case studies  discuss the  potential  for  diaspora bond  issuance  being deployed for climate investments including securitisation of remittances as collateral for infrastructure bonds (Ketkar and Ratha 2010; Akkoyunlu and Stern 2012; Gelb et al. 2021). Such instruments could help harness diaspora remittances whose flows rose from under 100 to 530 billion USD during 1990-2018 (World Bank 2019b). PDBs could benefit from technical partnership with multilaterals and other local  banks  (Torres  and  Zeidan  2016).  Their  knowledge  of  local  markets,  can  help  build  project pipelines (see  Figure  15.7)  to channel  local,  domestic  and international  capital  (Griffith-Jones  et al. 2020). Institutional domestic and international investors have growing assets estimated to exceed 100 trillion USD (high confidence) (Think Ahead Institute 2020; UN PRI 2020; Halland et al. 2021; Heredia et  al.  2021;  Inderst  2021)  and  could  be  better  mobilized.  Some  36  percent  of  total  assets  under management (AUM) by the 100 largest asset owners come from pensions and SWFs in the Asia Pacific region  with  the  remainder  split  almost  evenly  across  Europe,  the  Middle  East,  Africa  and  North Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-79  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 America. The largest pension fund in South Africa held about 130 billion USD AUM in 2019 and Africa institutional investors held USD 1.8 trillion in 2020 (GEPF 2019; PWC 2015; Bagus et al. 2020; Irving 2020). UK NGO (War on Want 2016) analysis of 101 fossil fuel and mineral resources companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) estimates these as holding a trillion USD assets inside Africa. The LAC region, holds just about USD 1 trillion AUM  (Serebrisky et al. 2015; Cavallo and Powell 2019).  Investors with  accumulated  private  capital  are  reported  as looking  for  climate  investments  to ensure Just Transition, alignment with Paris and SDGs.  However, progress remains pilot, slow and  piecemeal  (high  confidence).  Global  investors  have  published  statements  on  their  possible contribution  with  recommendations  to  governments  on  de-risking  to  accelerate  private  sector investment to support Paris aligned NDCs in  developing countries (IIGCC 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020; Global Investor Statement 2018; 2019).  In March 2020, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), had 3,038 members representing 103 trillion USD (UN PRI 2020);  another coalition of investors published  COVID-19  recovery  plans  (Investor  Agenda  2020)  and  the  Net  Zero  Asset  Managers initiative  was  launched  in  December  2020  (NZAM  2020).  However,  it  is  still  unclear  how  these pronouncements will be transformed to adequate financial flows and volumes of investment pipelines ((IEA 2021e), Chapter 3). (Rempel and Gupta 2020) posit that a proportion of institutional holding is in fossil fuels. Clean energy transition minerals raise ESG questions around inclusive development for indigenous populations and requires changes to  supply chains exploiting child labour (Herrington 2021; IEA 2021a,f).  Options  to  mobilise  institutional  investors  currently  remain  small  pilots,  relative  to  Paris  and  SDG ambitions (high confidence). In terms of sample examples: in the women of colour-led arena, a Chicago pension  fund  invested  in  a  developing  country  using  a  private  equity  fund;  (Langhorne  2021). Institutional  Blackrock’s  blended finance  vehicle  with  OECD  MDB  partners focuses on  developing countries  (Blackrock  2021).  In  regional  AAA  MDB  partnerships,  AfDB  collaborates  with  Africa nations through a regional infrastructure fund (Africa50 2020); ADB collaborates with a Philippines state-owned pension fund and Dutch pension fund in using a  private equity fund to catalyse private sector  (ADB  2012).  A  UN  entity  with several  pooled  public-private  investment platforms include  a SDG  blended  finance  vehicle  (UN  CDF  2020a,b,  2021a).  Multilateral  IFC  blended  finance  fund, supported by a sovereign guarantee from Sweden’s SIDA and separately a 1 billion USD green bond fund by IFC and Europe’s Amundi asset manager buys green securities issued by developing country banks financing local currency climate investments (IFC  2018; IFC 2021 2021; Amundi and IFC 2019). The key parameter is the investment multiplier, the ratio of private investment mobilised by a given amount of public funds which varies by product type. IFC’s portfolio of blended finance investments point to a self-reported range of 3 to 15 times for project debt and even higher levels (10 to 30) for debt finance provided on concessional terms (IFC 2021a 2021). Although AAA-rated IFC blended finance fund was established in 2013, it took on seven of its eight institutional investors in 2017 with insurers AXA and Swiss Re investing 500 million USD each to bring the fund to 7 billion USD raised from eight global investors (Attridge and Gouett 2021). Critics of blended finance mechanisms point to lack of  data  transparency  hampering  independent  assessment  on  i)  value  for  public  money  and  costs  of blending  versus  other  financial  mechanisms  ii)  risks  and  benefits  of  de-risking  private  capital  to collateralising climate vulnerable Global South populations iii) lack of partnership with local players iv)  complex  structures  (Akyüz  2017;  Mawdsley  2018;  Convergence  2020;  Daniela  Gabor  2021; Attridge  and  Gouett  2021).  Whilst  blended  finance  transactions  (BFTF  2018)  are  quite  common  in mature  regulated  markets  with  mandatory  reporting  requirements  (Morse  2015;  ICAEW  2021),  the additional finance mobilised and their developmental impact remain unknown due to poor reporting that hammpers evidence-based policy making (Attridge and Gouett 2021). Projects that are aligned with blended finance principles in the UN Addis Agenda (UN 2015a) and take account of local contexts by involving local actors are much more likely to have sustainable impacts.

Paris  aligned  NDCs  that integrate  policies  on  COVID-19  pandemic  recovery,  climate  action,  sustainable  development,  just transition and equity can harness co-benefits including contribution to “Invisible UN SDG 7 energy poverty  sectors”  (high  confidence).  Developing  countries  require  access  to  affordable  finance  for projects ranging from clean cooking solutions (Accenture 2018; World Bank et al. 2021); decentralised energy systems, intra-country power stations and regionally shared power pools with their associated energy  distribution  networks  (IEA  2020d;  IRENA  2020c).  Close  to  3  billion  people  in  Africa  and developing Asia have no access to clean cooking. For sub-Sahara Africa, the acute lack of electricity access lags behind all regions on SDG 7 indicators impacting mostly women and children (see Chapter 6, box 6.1; (IEA et al. 2021; IEA 2021e; Stritzke et al. 2021; Zhang 2021)). These dire statistics remind of  compounding  tensions:  Historical  inequities  and  the  associated  “first  comer’  exploiting  Africa resources for development elsewhere, the local climate change, “latecomer” capacity development and technology transfer challenges, illicit mining finance and stranded assets (UNU-INRA 2019; Bos and Gupta 2019; War on Want 2016; Arezki 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates this tension with more people pushed below the poverty line (Sumner et al. 2020) (see Box 15.6). Recent analysis points to the 60 largest banks providing 3.8 trillion USD to fossil fuel companies since 2016, including inside Africa (Rainforest Action Network et al. 2021). IMF estimated fossil fuel subsidies totalling 5.2 trillion USD or 6.5% of global GDP in 2017 (Coady et al. 2019) to be compared with the 2.4 trillion USD yr-1 energy investments over the next decade to limit global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC 2018). Analysts point to models in improvements to resources husbandry that include i) minerals strong governance SWFs for domestic development (Wills et al. 2016) and ii) compensation for Africa (Walsh et al. 2021) leaving fossil fuels underground (McGlade and Ekins 2015) in the Just Transition (section 15.2.4) and Right to Develop debates as assets continue to be mined (IEA 2019c). In many developing regions, some of the world’s best renewable energy sources remain out of reach due to high costs which can be up to seven times  that  in  developed  countries  (IEA  2021a).  Shifting  some  risks  through  financial  de-risking approaches could be instrumental (Schmidt 2014; Sweerts et al. 2019; Drumheller et al. 2020; Matthäus and Mehling 2020) . Combining approaches: i) developed countries meeting UNFCCC 100 billion USD commitment on a grant-equivalent basis ii) stepped up technical assistance iii) infrastructure co-ordination iv) knowledge sharing by project preparation entities iv) harnessing project risk facilities such as guarantees could be instrumental for scaling climate finance for Paris-SDGs (high confidence). Figure 15.7 illustrates the interplay between infrastructure project financing phases, bond refinancing and opportunities for developing bond yield curve benchmarks in nurturing local capital markets and mobilising  diverse  investors.  These  project  financing  phases  have  varying  risk-return  profiles  and different benchmarks to track performance are needed by investors for different types of securities that might be created (Ketterer 2014; Ketterer and Powell 2018).  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-81  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS  Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII Figure 15.7 Bond refinancing mobilises institutional investors in mature project phase.

During the very high-risk concept phase (Figure 15.7) – grants and technical assistance de-risk with design concepts, project proposals and feasibility studies completed to “kick-start” the right projects. The early stage developmental phase is characterised by short-term debt in the 2-5 year phase to complete construction enabled by concession finance. Bank loans are paid back by issuing bonds once the construction phase is completed. Such bond refinancing over say 15-25 years, in the low risk mature project phase can provide a lower cost of capital. Market-making to develop a pipeline of investment opportunities uses a complimentary mix of high-risk capital options in the form of grants, guarantees, equity, mezzanine financing that can help (Attridge and Gouett 2021)  i) reduce up-front risks in the early phases ii) allow banks to recycle loans to new projects iii) galvanise  multilateral  technical  assistance  for  building  bond  yield  curve  benchmarks  and  de-risking local currency bond issuance of long tenors such as green bonds/resilience bonds  (Berensmann et al. 2015; CBI 2015; Mercer 2018; Dasgupta et al. 2019; PIDG 2019; Braga et al. 2021; CBI et al. 2021; Hourcade  et  al.  2021a,b)  .  Convergence  2019  points  to  investment  from  commercial  banks  with commercial  debt  of  11-15years maturity  being  covered  by  guarantees.  To achieve  scale, some  have issued  SPV  green  infrastructure  project  bonds  combining  tenors  up  to  15  years  with  credit  ratings assigned  to  mobilise  investors  with  community  trusts  for  local  participation  (Mathews  and  Kidney 2012;  Kaminker  and  Stewart  2012;  Mbeng  Mezui  and  Hundal  2013;  Essers  et  al.  2016;  Moody’s Investors Service 2016; Ng and Tao 2016; Harber 2017). Bond refinancing could be facilitated through standardised national infrastructure style bonds, national infrastructure funds (Amonya 2009; Ketterer and  Powell  2018)  and  country  SPV  infrastructure  funds  issuing  bonds  (Cavallo  and  Powell  2019) embedding MDBs.

Individual and clubs of developed and developing countries  currently  provide  public  guarantees  (ADB  2015;  IIGCC  2015;  Pereira  Dos  Santos  2018; GGGI 2019; PIDG 2019; AGF 2020; Garbacz et al. 2021). However MDB business model imposes limitations  on  use  of  guarantees  and  collaboration  with  other  MDBs  (Gropp  et  al.  2014;  Schiff  and Dithrich 2017; Lee et al. 2018; Pereira dos Santos and Kearney 2018b). Loans continue to dominate as the  financial instrument  of  choice  by  MDBs  and  DFIs,  with  guarantees mobilising  the most  private finance for OECD reported data even if their use remains limited  (IATFD 2020; OECD 2020c; Attridge and Gouett 2021). Ramping up the use of guarantees to mobilise private investment raises questions around understanding efficacy in the design as there is no one size that fits all and more research is required to better understand this aspect (Convergence 2019). Sample guarantee forms in literature: i) single  country  Sweden  and  USA  DFI  forms  (SIDA  2016,  DCA  2018)  ii)  multilateral  institution offerings (Pereira Dos Santos 2018; IRENA 2020e) iii) multi-sovereign guarantees one-stop platforms such  as  those  on  the  PIDG/Guarantco  (PIDG  2019)  and  Africa  Guarantee  Fund  owned  by  DFIs, including AfDB, AFD, NDF, and KfW (AGF 2020)  iv) MIGA, established to provide political risk guarantees  (enhanced  green  MIGA)  (Déau  and  Touati  2018)    v)  multilateral  partnerships  with developing nations via infrastructure funds (see 15.6.7.2) and green infrastructure options (de Gouvello and Zelenko 2010; Studart and Gallagher 2015)  vi) guarantees embedded in project risk facilities such as  currency  fund  TCX  established  by  22  DFIs  (TCX  2020)  and  vii)  ASEAN  and  African  multi-sovereign  regional  local  currency  bond  guarantee  funds  and  a  co-guarantee  platform  (GGGI  2019; Garbacz et al. 2021). Fossil fuels currently benefit from de-risking tools from export credit agencies (Lawrence and Archer 2021)  with questions around sustainable development (Wright 2011)); (Gupta et al. 2020) argue that these could be deployed for renewable energy. C40 Cities Facility; Blue Natural Capital Facility (IUCN 2021); Clean Cooking Fund (ESMAP 2021) and opportunities for guarantees in LDCs (Garbacz et al. 2021). World Bank’s Renewables Risk Mitigation (GCF 2021), World Bank’s Global Infrastructure Facility. UNEP Seed Capital are sample project facilities across diverse project types (GGGI 2019). Multilaterals offer credit enhancement to manage both actual and perceived risks: in the  India  corporate sector, renewable  energy  SPV project  bonds  have  been guaranteed jointly by ADB and an infrastructure company raising the credit rating from sub-investment grade to investment grade to lower borrowing costs (ADB 2018; Agarwal and Singh 2018; Carrasco 2018).  Investment vehicles into green infrastructure come in various forms (high confidence) and can include indirect  corporate investment  such  as bonds;  semi-direct investment  funds  via  pooled vehicles  such infrastructure funds and private equity funds and project investment (direct) in green projects through equity and debt including loan, project bonds and green bonds. Pension funds in Australia and Canada direct investment in infrastructure is about 5% of total AUM (Inderst and Della Croce 2013) whilst less than 1% for OECD pension funds go to green infrastructure  (Kaminker et al. 2013). Some regional developing country institutional investors use a variety of investment vehicles that span SPVs, private equity, domestic and regional local currency bond markets  with statutory level mandates to address historic inequities (GEPF 2019). Cross-border collaboration in regional power markets such as Europe’s Nordpool; for developing countries could be led by technical partnership from infrastructure funds and multilaterals (Oseni and Pollitt 2016; Juvonen et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Nordpool 2021). Barriers to investments include non-standardised investment vehicles of scale and lack of national infrastructure road maps to give investor confidence in government commitment. Some have set up infrastructure co-ordinating entities embedding local science and engineering R&amp;D (IPA 2021; National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) 2021). (Arezki et al. 2016) argue that co-ordination within existing platforms could create a global infrastructure investment platform for de-risking through guarantees and securitization; (Matthäus and Mehling 2020) point to a global guarantee mechanism. Such multilateral approaches create credibility enhancing effects in developing capital markets. (Hourcade et al. 2021a) suggest that the overall economic efficiency could be higher with guarantees calibrated per ton on an agreed "social, economic, and environmental value of mitigation actions [and] their co-benefits" (Article 108, Paris Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-83  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII Agreement) which would operate as a notional carbon price (High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices 2017).

Such cooperative solutions in adopting development of local capital markets would end the drawbacks of the current plethora of low-scale fragmented project-by-project and ‘special-purpose’ pilots and programs. issued  by  sovereign/quasi-sovereign  entities Harnessing existing bond markets and securities exchanges in nascent markets. The G20 has an action  plan  to  support  strengthening  local  currency  bond  markets  and  development  of  local  capital markets is also part of the option for financing UN SDGs in developing countries (UN 2015a) 2015; UN 2019, 2020; IATFD 2016; UN IATFD 2021). Primers are available on bond market development to support policy choices (World Bank and IMF 2001; Silva et al. 2020; World Bank 2020; Adrian et al  2021;  IMF  and  World  Bank  2021).  Developing  government  bond  yield  curves  with  different maturities can be an important policy objective (high confidence). This can support pricing discovery, liquidity (Wooldridge 2001) and can be achieved through step by step tranches from shorter to longer maturities to boost confidence and encourage municipals and other quasi-sovereigns. Money market instruments (such as, green commercial paper) anchor the short end of the yield curve with bonds of varying  maturity treasuries,  SOEs, municipalities) to mobilise investors (Goodfriend 2011; LSEG 2018; Tolliver et al. 2019). A  variety of bonds are being used for developing countries including green (Ketterer et al. 2019), blue-water(Roth et al. 2019), transition, SDG/social, biodiversity bonds (Aglionby 2019), green/resilience bonds (AAC 2021);  gender  bonds  (Andrade  and  Prado  2020)(;  diaspora  (LSEG  2017)  and  infrastructure  project bonds (CBK 2021). Local policy-makers would gain from technical and financial assistance in building green yield curves, for example with support from multilaterals  (EIB 2012; IATFD 2016; Shi 2017; EIB 2018). Green bonds are one of the most readily accessible to help fund Paris goals (Tolliver et al. 2019; Tuhkanen and Vulturius 2020). Section 15.3.2 refers to the growth in labelled bond markets (CBI 2021b),  low  borrowing  costs  and  yield  curve  building  in  Europe  (Bahceli  2020;  Serenelli  2021; Stubbington 2021; HM Treasury and UK DMO 2021). For developing countries, labelled bonds have mostly been in hard currency (e.g. (Smith 2021)) despite local currency markets making up more than 80 percent total debt stock (IMF and World Bank 2016; Silva et al. 2020; Adrian et al 2021; Inderst 2021). The labelled bonds issuance by multilaterals do not currently mobilise the trillion levels needed. Research studies show that participating in green bond markets in part depends on a country having credible NDCs (Tolliver et al. 2020a,b) and highlights diverse approaches working together to support local bond market development (Amacker and Donovan 2021; ICMA 2021; IMF and World Bank 2021) (national Technical assistance options would benefit from co-ordination. Labelled bond costs remain high. Developing countries are using fiscal incentives, grants, and guarantees to support nascent bond markets  with  most  taxonomies  under  development  (high  confidence).  Technical  assistance requirements to improve the investment climate and bond market development will vary across national capacities. These would benefit from the 100 billion USD UNFCCC grant equivalent basis to develop i) regulatory and policy frameworks ii) UN national statistical systems (Singh et al. 2016; MacFeely and Barnat 2017; Paris21 2018; Bleeker and Abdulkadri 2020);iii) credible NDC and SDG investment plans iv) project assessment certification and taxonomies v) bond market guidelines vi) public finance management  (US  DoJ  2019,  2009).  Other  technical  assistance  channels  include  diaspora  entities, universities and learned societies (ICEAW 2012; Mahmud and Huq 2018; UNFCCC 2021). LDCs are least  likely  to  have  active  capital  markets.  Clubs  of  LDCs  are  partnering  with  AAA  MDBs  in aggregation approaches (AfDB 2020; GCF 2020b). Some UN entities provide technical assistance on municipal aggregation of projects (UN CDF 2020) with Africa, LDC, SIDS nations and cities accessing green technical facilities and listings for labelled bonds (C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group 2016; Gorelick 2018; Jackson 2019; FSD Africa and CBI 2020; Gorelick and Walmsley 2020; MoE Fiji 2020 2020; IFC 2021).

In the regions, China issued guidelines for stock exchanges and regulatory support for green bonds (Cao and Ma 2021), India issued regulations for local issuance of green bonds (CBI 2019a) while in the LAC region; both plain vanilla and labelled bonds use the same authority (Ketterer et al. 2019). Africa, LDC and SIDS nations are reviewing ways to harness local exchanges  (SSE 2018; GCF 2019; ASEA et al 2021; UN CDF 2021b). For taxonomies, the differences reflect the multitude of local Just Transition pathways, some with purely environmental focus and others incorporating livelihood improvements (ICMA 2021). The sustainable bond market has  been  expanding  as  transition  bonds  become  listed  in  anticipation  of future developments  (Roos 2021).  Progress towards transparency using scientific-based methods to build trust and accountability. After  60years  of  development  finance,  critics  underline  limits  coming  from  i)  lack  of  aid  and  debt transparency  (Moyo  2009;  Mkandawire  2010;  PWYF  2020)  ii)  mining-fossil  fuels  sector  and illicit finance  (Plank  1993;  Sachs  and  Warner  2001;  Hanlon  2017b)  )  iii)  lack  of  developed  country commitment to pledges (Nhamo and Nhamo 2016) iv) unregulated players as financial intermediaries in  blended  finance  (Pereira  2017;  Donaldson  and  Hawkes  2018;  Tan  2019)  v)  weak  accountability reflected in soft SDG data measurement and vi) burden of responsibility in mobilising resources for Paris and SDG to countries with historically soft institutional capacity (Hickel 2015; Donald and Way 2016; Scheyvens et al. 2016; Liverman 2018). Literature around trust in blended finance pinpoints four progress areas in accountability. First, debt transparency through public debt registries, centralised UN legacy debt restructuring and science-centred UN national statistical systems (Donaldson and Hawkes 2018; Jubilee Debt Campaign 2019; Stiglitz and Rashid 2020). Second, international reporting bell-weathers could be called upon to produce harmonized mandatory reporting frameworks that capitalize on TCFD to capture climate, debt sustainability (see 15.6.7.3), SDG and fossil fuel (GISD 2020); third, standardization  of  assessment  by  third  parties  of  the  quantity  and  values  of  carbon  saved  by  green projects (Hourcade et al. 2012) and of their contribution to quantified performance biodiversity targets (FfB 2021) to facilitate their bundling, securitization and repackaging in standardized liquid products and bonds (Arezki et al. 2016; Blended Finance Taskforce 2018a). 15.6.8  Facilitating the development of new business models and financing approaches  New and innovative business models and financing approaches have emerged to help overcome barriers related to transactions costs by aggregating and/or transferring financing needs and establishing supply of finance for stakeholder groups lacking financial inclusion (high confidence). 15.6.8.1  Service-based business models in the energy and transport sectors Energy-as-a-service (EaaS) is a business model whereby customers pay for an energy service without having to make any upfront capital investment (PWC 2014; Hamwi and Lizarralde 2017; Cleary and Palmer 2019). EaaS performance-based contracts can also be a form of “creative financing” for capital improvement that makes it possible to fund energy upgrades from cost reductions and deployment of decentralised  renewable  energy  (KPMG  2015;  Moles-Grueso  et  al.  2021).  Innovation  in  EaaS  has started at the household level, where smart meters using real-time data are used to predict peak demand levels and optimise electricity dispatch (Chasin et al. 2020)(Government of UK 2016) (Smart Energy International 2018).  Aggregators. An aggregator is a grouping of agents in a power system to act as a single entity when engaging in power system markets (MIT 2016). Aggregators can use operation optimisation platforms to provide real-time operating reserve capacity and a range of balancing services to integrate higher shares  of  variable  renewable  energy  (VRE)  (Zancanella  et  al.  2016)(Ma  et  al.  2017;  Enbala  2018; Research and Markets 2017; IRENA 2019b).

Aggregating and managing demand-response of heat systems (micro CHP and heat pumps) has shown reduction in peak demand (TNO 2016).  Peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading. Producers and consumers can directly trade electricity with other consumers in an online marketplace to avoid the relatively high tariffs and the relatively low buy-back rates of traditional utilities (IRENA 2020f; Liu et al. 2019). P2P models trading with distributed energy resources reduce transmission losses and congestion  (Mengelkamp et al. 2018; SEDA 2020; Lumenaza 2020; Sonnen 2020; UNFCCC 2020). Community-ownership models. Community-ownership models refer to the collective ownership and management of energy-related assets with lower levels of investment, usually distributed renewable energy resources but also recently in heating systems and energy services (e.g. storage and charging) (Gall 2018; IRENA 2018; Kelly and Hanna 2019; Singh et al. 2019; Bisello et al. 2021; Maclurcan and Hinton 2021). Community-ownership projects may need significant upfront investments, and the ability of communities to raise the required financing might prove insufficient, which can be supported by microcredits in the initial stages of the projects (Aitken 2013; Federici 2014; REN21 2016; Rescoop 2020). Payment method: Pay-as-you-go (PayGo). PayGo business models emerged to address the energy access challenge and provide chiefly solar energy at affordable prices, using mobile telecommunication to facilitate payment through instalments (IRENA 2019c) (Yadav et al. 2019). However, PayGo has the technology  and  product  risk,  requires  a  financially  viable  and  large  customer  base,  and  the  system supplier must provide a significant portion of the finance and requires substantial equity and working capital (C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group 2018).   Transport sector business models. Analog to EaaS, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) offers a business model whereby customers pay for a mobility service without making any upfront capital investment (e.g., buying a car). MaaS tends to deliver significant urban benefits (e.g., cleaner air) and brings in efficiency gains in the use of resources (high confidence). However, the switch to MaaS hardly improves the  carbon  footprint  and  further  tempted  on-demand  mobility  is  likely  to  nurture  carbon  emissions (Suatmadi et al. 2019). Therefore, to support climate change mitigation, MaaS must be integrated with the  deployment  of  smart  charging  of  electric  (autonomous)  vehicles  coupled  to  renewable  energy sources (IRENA 2019d)(Jones and Leibowicz 2019). Financial technology applications to climate change. Financial technology abbreviated as 'fintech' applies to data-driven technological solutions that aims to improve financial services (Schueffel 2018; Dorfleitner  et  al.  2017;  Lee  and  Shin  2018).  Fintech  can  enhance  climate  investment  in  innovative financial products and build trust through data, but also presents some challenges including related to potentially  significant  emissions  from  increased  energy  use  with  distributed  transactions  (Lei  et  al. 2021). Blockchain is a key fintech that secures individual transactions in a distributed system, which can have many applications with high impact potential but is also associated with uncertainty (OECD 2019c;  World  Energy  Council  2019).  Fintech  applications  with  climate  change  mitigation  potential have been growing recently, including tracking payment or asset history for credit scoring in AFOLU activities (Nassiry 2018; Davidovic et al. 2019), blockchain supported grid transactions (Livingston et al.  2018),  carbon  accounting  throughout  value  chains  (World  Bank  2018b),  or  transparency  and verification  mechanisms  for  green  financial  instrument  investors  (Kyriakou  et  al.  2017;  Stockholm Green  Digital  Finance  2017).  Generally,  blockchain  and  digital  currency  applications  are  not  well covered  by  governance  systems  (Tapscott  and  Kirkland  2016;  Nassiry  2018),  which  could  lead  to problems  with  security  (Davidovic  et  al.  2019),  and  some  licensing  and  prudential  supervision frameworks are in flux.

Nature-based solutions consist of a wide range of measures including ecosystem-based mitigation and adaptation.  The  studies  on  the  investment  and  finance  for  the  nature-based  solutions  is  still  limited.  However, framework and schemes to incentivise the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as reducing emissions  from  deforestation  and  forest  degradation  and  the  role  of  conservation,  sustainable management  of  forests  and  enhancement  of  forest  carbon  stocks  in  developing  countries  (REDD+), which contributes to the climate change mitigation has been actively discussed under the UNFCCC, with lessons from finance for REDD+ being available.  If effectively implemented, nature-based solutions can be cost-effective measures and able to provide multiple benefits, such as enhanced climate resilience, enhanced climate change mitigation, biodiversity habitat,  water  filtration,  soil  health,  and  amenity  values  (Griscom  et  al.  2017;  Keesstra  et  al.  2018; OECD 2019d; Griscom et al. 2020; Dasgupta 2021) (high confidence).  The  nature-based  solutions  have  large  potential  to  address  climate  change  and  other  sustainable development  issues  (high  confidence).  Nature-based  solutions  are  undercapitalised  and  the  limited investment  and  finance,  especially  limited  private  capital  is  widely  recognised  as  one  of  the  main barriers  to  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  nature-based  solutions  (Seddon  et  al.  2020; Toxopeus and Polzin 2021; UNEP et al. 2021) Finance and investment models that generates its own revenues or consistently saves costs are necessary to reduce dependency on grants (Schäfer et al. 2019; Wamsler et al. 2020). REDD+. REDD+, can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation and also produce other co-benefits  like  climate  change  adaptation,  biodiversity  conservation,  and  poverty  reduction,  if  well-implemented (Milbank et al. 2018; Morita and Matsumoto 2018) (high confidence). We use the term REDD+ broadly, not limited to REDD+ implemented under the UNFCCC decisions, including Warsaw Framework  for  REDD+  (see  Chapter  14),  but  include  voluntary  REDD+  projects,  such  as  projects which  utilise  voluntary  carbon  markets.  Finance  is  a  core  element  that  incentivise  and  implement REDD+ activities. Various financial sources are financing REDD+ activities, including bilateral and multilateral,  public  and  private,  and  international  and  domestic  sources,  with  linking  with  several finance approaches/mechanisms including results-based finance and voluntary carbon markets (FAO 2018). However, there is lack of sufficient finance for REDD+ (Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018; Maguire et al. 2021). REDD+ under the UNFCCC are implemented in three phases, readiness, implementation, and results-based payment phases. The Ecosystem Marketplace identified that at least USD 5.4 billion in REDD+ in three phases funding committed through multiple development finance institutions so far (Maguire et al. 2021), and public funds are main sources that are supporting three phases, and most of the REDD+ finance were spent to the readiness phase (Atmadja et al. 2018; Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018; Watson and Schalatek 2021). There is significant gap between the existing finance and finance needs  of  REDD+  in  each  phase  (Lujan  and  Silva-Chávez  2018).  Furthermore,  private  sector contribution to REDD+ is currently limited mostly to the project-scale payments for carbon offsets/units through voluntary carbon market (McFarland 2015; Lujan and Silva-Chávez 2018).  Current  main  challenges  of  REDD+  finance  include  the  uncertainty  of  compliance  carbon  markets (which  allow  regulated  entities  to  obtain  and  surrender  emissions  allowances  or  offsets  to  meet regulatory emissions reduction targets) (Maguire et al. 2021), as well as limited engagement of private sector  in  REDD+  finance  (high  confidence).  With  regard  to  the  compliance  carbon  markets,  at  the international level, integrating climate cooperation through carbon markets into Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and including REDD+  has  potential to  enable  emission  reduction  in  more  cost-effective way, while the links between carbon markets and REDD+ under the Article 6 is under discussion at the Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-87  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 UNFCCC (Environmental Defense Fund 2019; Maguire et al. 2021) (see Chapter 14). At the national and subnational levels, although compliance carbon markets such as in New Zealand, Australia and Colombia  allow  forest  carbon  units,  how  REDD+  will  be  dealt  in  the  national  and  subnational government- led compliance carbon markets are uncertain (Streck 2020; Maguire et al. 2021). As for limited engagement of private sector in REDD+ finance, there are various reasons why mobilising more private finance in REDD+ is difficult (Dixon and Challies 2015; Laing et al. 2016; Golub et al. 2018; Ehara et al. 2019; Streck 2020). The challenges include the needs of a clear understanding of carbon rights  and  transparent  regulation  on  who  can  benefit  from  national  REDD+  (Streck  2020);  a  clear regulatory framework and market certainty (Dixon and Challies 2015; Laing et al. 2016; Golub et al. 2018;  Ehara  et  al.  2019);  strong  forest  governance  (Streck  2020),  and  implementation  of  REDD+ activities in different levels, national and subnational levels. Other challenges are associated with the nature  of  forest-based  mitigation  activities,  the  costs  and  complexity  for  monitoring,  reporting  and verification  of  REDD+  activities,  because  of  the  need  to  consider  the  risks  of  permanence,  carbon leakage, and precisely determine and monitor the forest carbon sinks (van der Gaast et al. 2018; Yanai et al. 2020). Although REDD+ has many challenges to mobilise more private finance, there is discussion on exploring other finance opportunities for forest sector, such as building new blended finance models combining different funding sources like public and private finance (Streck 2016; Rode et al. 2019), and developing enhanced bonds for forest-based mitigation activities (World Bank 2017). Private finance opportunities for nature-based solutions. The development of nature-based solutions face  barriers  that  relate  to  the  value  proposition,  value  delivery  and  value  capture  of  nature-based solutions business models and sustainable sources of public/private finance to tap into (Toxopeus and Polzin 2017; Mok et al. 2021) (high confidence). However, the demand of establishing new finance and business models to attract both public and private finance to nature-based solutions is increasing in a wide  range  of  topics  such  as  urban  areas,  forestry  and  agriculture  sectors,  and  blue  natural  capital including mangroves and coral reefs (Toxopeus and Polzin 2017; EIB 2019; Cziesielski et al. 2021; Mok et al. 2021; Thiele et al. 2021; UNEP et al. 2021) Furthermore, the recognition of the needs of financial institutions to identify the physical, transition and reputational risks resulting from not only the climate change but also loss of biodiversity is gradually increasing (De Nederlandsche Bank and PBL  Netherlands  Environmental  Assessment  Agency  2020;  Dasgupta  2021;  TNFD  2021). Development  of  finance  and  business  models  for  nature-based  solutions  need  to  be  explored,  for example  through  utilizing  a  wide  range  of  financial  instruments  (e.g.  equity,  loans,  bonds,  and insurance),  and  creating  standard  metrics,  baselines  and  common  characteristics  for  nature-based solutions to promote the creation of a new asset class (Thiele et al. 2021; UNEP et al. 2021). 15.6.8.3 Exploring gender-responsive climate finance Global and national recognition of the lack of finance for women has led to increasing emphasis on financial inclusion for women (high confidence). Currently, it is estimated that 980 million women are excluded from formal financial system (Miles and Wiedmaier-Pfister 2018); and there is a 9% gender gap in financial access across developing countries (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2018). This gender gap is the percent  of  men  and  women  with  bank  accounts  as  measured  and  reported  in  the  Global  Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database. Policies and framework to expand and enhance financial inclusion also extend to the area of climate finance (high confidence). Since AR5, there remains many questions and not enough evidence on the gender, distribution and allocative effectiveness of climate finance in the context of gender equality and women’s empowerment (Williams 2015a; Chan et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2019). Nonetheless, the existing global policy framework (entry points, policy priorities etc.) of climate funds is gradually improving in order to support women’s financial inclusion in both the public and the private dimensions of climate finance/investment (Schalatek 2015; Chan et al. 2018; Schalatek 2020). At the level of public multilateral climate funds, there have been significant improvements in integrating gender equality and women’s empowerment issues in the governance structures, policies, project  approval  and  implementation  processes  of  existing  multilateral  climate  funds  such  as  the UNFCCC’s funds managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the World Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-88  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Bank’s  CIFs  (Schalatek  2015;  Williams  2015a;  GGCA  2016;  GCF  2017)  (high  confidence).  But according  to  a  recent  evaluation  report,  the  integration  of  gender  into  operational  policies  and programme  is  fragmented  and  there  is  lack  of  an  ‘adequate,  systematic  and  comprehensive  gender equality  approach  for  the  allocation  and  distribution  of  funds  for  projects  and  programmes  on  the ground’ (GEF Independent Evaluation Office 2017; Schalatek 2018). The review found that ‘almost half of the analysed sample of 70 climate projects were judged to be largely gender-blind, and only 5% considered  to  have  successfully  mainstreamed  gender,  including  in  two  Least  Developed  Countries Fund adaptation projects’ (GEF Independent Evaluation Office 2017; Schalatek 2018). While the GCF requires funding proposals to consider gender impact as part of their investment framework7, the fund does not have its own funding stream targeted to women’s project on the ground, nor is there as yet an evaluation as to how entities are actually implementing gender action plan in the projects. In the case of the CIFs, as noted by (Schalatek 2018), ‘gender is not included in the operational principles of the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), which funds programmatic adaptation portfolios in a few developing  countries,  although  most  pilot  countries  have  included  some  gender  dimensions’.  And, ‘gender is not integrated into the operations of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), which finances large-scale mitigation in large economies and accounts for 70% of the CIFs pledged funding portfolio of 8.2 billion USD’ (Schalatek 2018). However, both the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Low-Income Countries Program (SREP) have integrated gender equality as either a co-benefit or core criteria of these programmes (Schalatek 2018).  Overall, efforts to promote gender responsive/sensitive climate finance, at national and local levels, both in the public and private dimensions and more specifically in mitigation-oriented sectors such as clean and renewable energy remains deficient (high confidence). Recent developments in the capital markets in the areas of social bond are focused around gender bonds  -- debt instruments targeted to activities and behaviours that are relevant to gender equality and women’s empowerment. These bonds are aligned with Sustainability-linked Bonds as well as Social Bonds Principles of the International Capital Market Association. Issuances of gender-labelled bonds are increasing in the Asia Pacific region (the most comprehensive initiative is the Impact Investment Exchange’s (IIX) multi-country USD150 million Women’s Livelihood Bond8) and in Latin America, Columbia, Mexico and Panama each have gender bond issuances). Additionally, a few developing countries, such as Pakistan (May 2021) and Morocco (March 2021) have issued gender bond guidelines for financial market participants. Linkage  to  sectoral  climate  change  issues  and  gender  and  climate  finance.  Subsets  of  actions designed to enhance women’s more formal integration into climate policies, programmes and actions by the global private sector include: investment in clean energy, redirecting funds to support women and vulnerable region as a component of social and green bonds as well as insurance for climate risk management. In the latter context, insurance providers are arguing that ‘given the fact that women are disproportionately affected by climate change, there could be new finance innovations to address this gap.’ AXA and IFC estimate that the global women’s insurance market has the opportunity to grow to three times its current size, to 1.7 trillion USD by 2030  (AXA Group et al. 2015; GIZ et al. 2017). However, across the board and in particular with regard to public funds, despite improvements in the substantive  gender  sensitization  and  operational  gender  responsiveness  of  multilateral  and  bilateral climate finance funds operations, current flows of public and climate finance do not seem to be going FOOTNOTE7 Notably, the GCF provides guidance to Accredited Entities submitting funding proposals on the inclusion of an initial gender and social assessment during the project planning, preparation and development stage and a gender and social inclusion action plan at the project preparation stage.

At the same  time,  evaluations  of  the  effectiveness  of  climate  finance  show  that  equitable  flow  of  climate finance can play an important role in levelling the playing field and in enabling women and men to successful respond to climate change and to enable the success and sustainability of local response in ensuring  effective and sustainable climate strategies that can contribute to the global goals of the Paris Agreement (Minniti and Naudé 2010; Bird et al. 2013; Barrett 2014; Eastin 2018). This is particularly, so in the case of female-owned MSMEs, who, the literature increasingly show, are key to promoting resilience at micro and macro scale in many developing countries (Omolo et al. 2017; Atela et al. 2018; Crick, F. et al. 2018). Frequently Asked Questions  FAQ 15.1 What’s the role of climate finance and the finance sector for a transformation towards a sustainable future? The Paris Agreement has widened the scope of all financial flows from climate finance only to the full alignment of finance flows with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. While climate finance relates historically to the financial support of developed countries to developing countries, the Paris Agreement and its Article 2.1(c) has developed on a new narrative on that goes much beyond traditional flows  and  relates  to  all  sectors  and  actors.  Finance  flows  are  consistent  when  the  effects  are  either neutral  with  or  without  positive  climate  co-benefits  to  climate  objectives;  or  explicitly  targeted  on climate  benefits  in  adaptation  and/or  mitigation  result  areas.  Climate-related  financial  risk  is  still massively underestimated by financial institutions, financial decision-makers more generally and also among public sector stakeholders limiting the sector’s potential of being an enabler of the transition. The private sector has started to recognise climate-related risks and consequently redirect investment flows. Dynamics vary across sectors and regions with the financial sector being an enabler of transitions in  only  some  selected  (sub-)sectors  and  regions.  Consistent,  credible,  timely  and  forward-looking political leadership remains central to strengthen the financial sector as enabler. FAQ 15.2 What’s the current status of global climate finance and the alignment of global financial flows with the Paris Agreement? There is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term 'climate finance' is applied to the financial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales,  including  international  financial  flows  to  developing  countries  to  assist  them  in  addressing climate change. Total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect aims to reduce net  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and/or  to  enhance  resilience  to  the  impacts  of  current  and projected climate change. This includes private and public funds, domestic and international flows and expenditures.  Tracking  of  climate  finance  flows  faces  limitations,  in  particular  for  national  climate finance flows.  Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. Annual global climate finance flows are on an upward trend since the fifth Assessment Report, according to CPI reaching more than 630 billion USD in 2019/2020, however, growth has likely slowed down and flows  remain  significantly  below  needs.  This  is  driven  by  barriers  within  and  outside  the  financial sector. More than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities despite the strong economic rationale of adaptation action.  Adjusting for higher estimates on current flows for energy efficiency based on IEA data, the dominance of mitigation becomes even stronger. Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil-fuel related financing as well as other misaligned flows continue to be of major concern despite promising recent commitments. Significant progress has been made in the commercial finance sector with regard to the awareness of climate risks resulting from inadequate financial flows and climate action. However, a more consequent investment and policy decision making that enables a Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute 15-90  Total pages: 157 ACCEPTED VERSION SUBJECT TO FINAL EDITS   Final Government Distribution  Chapter 15 IPCC AR6 WGIII 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 rapid redirection of financial flows is needed. Regulatory support as a catalyser is an essential convey of such redirections. Dynamics across sectors and regions vary with some being better positioned to close financing gaps and to benefit from an enabling role of finance in the short-term.  FAQ 15.3 What defines a financing gap, and where are the critically identified gaps?  A financing gap is defined as the difference between current flows and average needs to meet the long term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  Gaps  are  driven  by  various  barriers  inside  (short-termism, information gaps, home bias, limited visibility of future pipelines) and outside (e.g. missing pricing of externalities, missing regulatory frameworks) of the financial sector. Current mitigation financing flows come  in  significantly  below  average  needs  across  all  regions  and  sectors  despite  the  availability  of sufficient capital on a global basis. Globally, yearly climate finance flows have to increase by factor between 3 to 6 to meet average annual needs until 2030. Gaps  are  in  particular  concerning  for  many  developing  countries  with  COVID-19  exacerbating  the macroeconomic  outlook  and  fiscal  space  for  governments.  Also,  limited  institutional  capacity represents  a  key  barrier  for  many  developing  countries  burdening  risk  perceptions  and  access  to appropriately priced financing as well as limiting their ability to actively manage the transformation. Existing fundamental inequities in access to finance as well as its terms and conditions, and countries exposure to physical impacts of climate change overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition.
