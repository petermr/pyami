Covering  two-thirds  of  the  planet, the  ocean  hosts  vast  biodiversity  and  modulates  the  global  climate system  by  regulating  cycles  of  heat,  water  and  elements,  including carbon.  Marine  systems  are  central  to  many  cultures,  and  they  also provide  food,  minerals,  energy  and  employment  to  people.  Since previous  assessments1,  new  laboratory  studies,  field  observations and process studies, a wider range of model simulations, Indigenous knowledge,  and  local  knowledge  have  provided  increasing  evidence on the impacts of climate change on ocean and coastal systems, how human communities are experiencing these impacts, and the potential solutions for ecological and human adaptation.Observations: vulnerabilities and impactsAnthropogenic climate change has exposed ocean and coastal ecosystems to conditions that are unprecedented over millennia (high  confidence2),  and  this  has  greatly  impacted  life  in  the ocean and along its coasts (very high confidence). Fundamental changes  in  the  physical  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the  ocean acting individually and together are changing the timing of seasonal activities (very high confidence), distribution (very high confidence) and abundance (very high confidence) of oceanic and coastal organisms, from  microbes  to  mammals  and  from  individuals  to  ecosystems, in  every  region.  Evidence  of  these  changes  is  apparent  from  multi-decadal  observations,  laboratory  studies  and  mesocosms,  as  well  as meta-analyses  of  published  data.  Geographic  range  shifts  of  marine species  generally  follow  the  pace  and  direction  of  climate  warming (high  confidence):  surface  warming  since  the  1950s  has  shifted marine taxa and communities poleward at an average (mean ± very likely3  range)  of  59.2  ±  15.5 km  per  decade  (high  confidence), with  substantial  variation  in  responses  among  taxa  and  regions. Seasonal events occur 4.3 ± 1.8 d to 7.5 ± 1.5 d earlier per decade among planktonic organisms (very high confidence) and on average 3 ± 2.1 d earlier per decade for fish (very high confidence). Warming, acidification  and  deoxygenation  are  altering  ecological  communities by  increasing  the  spread  of  physiologically  suboptimal  conditions for  many  marine  fish  and  invertebrates  (medium  confidence). These and other responses have subsequently driven habitat loss (very high confidence),  population  declines  (high  confidence),  increased  risks of  species  extirpations  and  extinctions  (medium  confidence)  and rearrangement  of  marine  food  webs  (medium  to  high  confidence, depending  on  ecosystem).  {3.2,  3.3,  3.3.2,  3.3.3,  3.3.3.2,  3.4.2.1, 3.4.2.3–3.4.2.8, 3.4.2.10, 3.4.3.1, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.3.3, Box 3.2}Marine heatwaves lasting weeks to several months are exposing species  and  ecosystems  to  environmental  conditions  beyond their  tolerance  and  acclimation  limits  (very  high  confidence). WGI AR6 concluded that marine heatwaves are more frequent (high confidence), more intense and longer (medium confidence) since the 1980s, and since at least 2006 very likely attributable to anthropogenic climate  change.  Open-ocean,  coastal  and  shelf-sea  ecosystems, including coral reefs, rocky shores, kelp forests, seagrasses, mangroves, the  Arctic  Ocean  and  semi-enclosed  seas,  have  recently  undergone mass  mortalities  from  marine  heatwaves  (very  high  confidence). Marine  heatwaves,  including  well-documented  events  along  the west coast of North America (2013–2016) and east coast of Australia (2015–2016, 2016–2017 and 2020), drive abrupt shifts in community composition  that  may  persist  for  years  (very  high  confidence),  with associated biodiversity loss (very high confidence), collapse of regional fisheries  and  aquaculture  (high  confidence)  and  reduced  capacity  of habitat-forming species to protect shorelines (high confidence). {WGI AR6  Chapter  9,  3.2.2.1,  3.4.2.1–3.4.2.5,  3.4.2.7,  3.4.2.10,  3.4.2.3, 3.4.3.3.3, 3.5.3}At local to regional scales, climate change worsens the impacts on marine life of non-climate anthropogenic drivers, such as habitat degradation, marine pollution, overfishing and overharvesting, nutrient enrichment and introduction of non-indigenous species (very  high  confidence).  Although  impacts  of  multiple  climate  and non-climate  drivers  can  be  beneficial  or  neutral  to  marine  life,  most are  detrimental  (high  confidence).  Warming  exacerbates  coastal eutrophication  and  associated  hypoxia,  causing  ‘dead  zones’  (very high confidence), which drive severe impacts on coastal and shelf-sea ecosystems (very high confidence), including mass mortalities, habitat reduction and fisheries disruptions (medium confidence). Overfishing exacerbates effects of multiple climate-induced drivers on predators at the top of the marine food chain (medium confidence). Urbanisation and associated changes in freshwater and sediment dynamics increase the  vulnerability  of  coastal  ecosystems  like  sandy  beaches,  salt marshes and mangrove forests to sea level rise and changes in wave energy  (very  high  confidence).  Although  these  non-climate  drivers confound attribution of impacts to climate change, adaptive, inclusive and evidence-based management reduces the cumulative pressure on ocean and coastal ecosystems, which will decrease their vulnerability to  climate  change  (high  confidence).  {3.3,  3.3.3,  3.4.2.4–3.4.2.8, 3.4.3.4, 3.5.3, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3}Climate-driven impacts on ocean and coastal environments have caused  measurable  changes  in  specific  industries,  economic losses,  emotional  harm  and  altered  cultural  and  recreational activities  around  the  world  (high  confidence).  Climate-driven movement of fish stocks is causing commercial, small-scale, artisanal 31 2 3 Previous IPCC assessments include the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (IPCC, 2013; IPCC, 2014b; IPCC, 2014c; IPCC, 2014d), the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (IPCC, 2018), the Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (IPCC, 2019b) and the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Working Group I (WGI AR6).In this Report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and is typeset in italics (e.g., medium confidence). For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence.In this Report, the following terms are used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10% and exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than not &gt;50–100% and extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics (e.g., very likely). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% probability range.3813Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesand  recreational  fishing  activities  to  shift  poleward  and  diversify harvests (high confidence). Climate change is increasing the geographic spread and risk of marine-borne pathogens like Vibrio sp. (very high confidence), which endanger human health and decrease provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (high confidence). Interacting climate-induced  drivers  and  non-climate  drivers  are  enhancing  movement and  bioaccumulation  of  toxins  and  contaminants  into  marine  food webs  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement),  and  increasing  salinity of  coastal  waters,  aquifers  and  soils  (very  high  confidence),  which endangers  human  health  (very  high  confidence).  Combined  climate-induced drivers and non-climate drivers also expose densely populated coastal  zones  to  flooding  (high  confidence)  and  decrease  physical protection  of  people,  property  and  culturally  important  sites  (very high confidence). {3.4.2.10, 3.5.3, 3.5.5, 3.5.5.3, 3.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3}Projections: vulnerabilities, risks and impactsOcean  conditions  are  projected  to  continue  diverging  from  a pre-industrial  state  (virtually  certain),  with  the  magnitude of  warming,  acidification,  deoxygenation,  sea  level  rise  and other  climate-induced  drivers  depending  on  the  emission scenario (very high confidence), and to increase risk of regional extirpations and global extinctions of marine species (medium confidence). Marine species richness near the equator and in the Arctic is projected to continue declining, even with less than 2°C warming by  the  end  of  the  century  (medium  confidence).  In  the  deep  ocean, all global warming levels will cause faster movements of temperature niches by 2100 than those that have driven extensive reorganisation of  marine  biodiversity  at  the  ocean  surface  over  the  past  50  years (medium confidence). At warming levels beyond 2°C by 2100, risks of extirpation, extinction and  ecosystem collapse escalate  rapidly (high confidence).  Paleorecords  indicate  that  at  extreme  global  warming levels (&gt;5.2°C), mass extinction of marine species may occur (medium confidence). {Box 3.2, 3.2.2.1, 3.4.2.5, 3.4.2.10, 3.4.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1}increases Climate  impacts  on  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems  will  be exacerbated  by intensity,  reoccurrence  and in duration of marine heatwaves (high confidence), in some cases, leading  to  species  extirpation,  habitat  collapse  or  surpassing ecological  tipping  points  (very  high  confidence). Some habitat-forming coastal ecosystems including many coral reefs, kelp forests and seagrass meadows, will undergo irreversible phase shifts due to marine heatwaves with global warming levels &gt;1.5°C and are at high risk this century even in &lt;1.5°C scenarios that include periods of temperature overshoot  beyond  1.5°C  (high  confidence).  Under  SSP1-2.6,  coral reefs are at risk of widespread decline, loss of structural integrity and transitioning to net erosion by mid-century due to increasing intensity and  frequency  of  marine  heatwaves  (very  high  confidence).  Due  to these  impacts,  the  rate  of  sea  level  rise  is  very  likely  to  exceed  that of reef growth by 2050, absent adaptation. Other coastal ecosystems, including  kelp  forests,  mangroves  and  seagrasses,  are  vulnerable  to phase  shifts  towards  alternate  states  as  marine  heatwaves  intensify (high  confidence).  Loss  of  kelp  forests  are  expected  to  be  greatest at  the  low-latitude  warm  edge  of  species’  ranges  (high  confidence). {3.4.2.1, 3.4.2.3, 3.4.2.5, 3.4.4}Escalating impacts of climate change on marine life will further alter  biomass  of  marine  animals  (medium  confidence),  the timing  of  seasonal  ecological  events  (medium  confidence) and the geographic ranges of coastal and ocean taxa (medium confidence),  disrupting (medium  confidence), life  cycles food  webs  (medium  confidence)  and  ecological  connectivity throughout  the  water  column  (medium  confidence).  Multiple lines  of  evidence  suggest  that  climate-change  responses  are  very likely to amplify up marine food webs over large regions of the ocean. Modest projected declines in global phytoplankton biomass translate into  larger  declines  of  total  animal  biomass  (by  2080–2099  relative to 1995–2014) ranging from (mean ± very likely range) −5.7 ± 4.1% to −15.5 ± 8.5% under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (medium confidence). Projected declines in upper-ocean nutrient concentrations, likely  associated  with  increases  in  stratification,  will  reduce  carbon export  flux  to  the  mesopelagic  and  deep-sea  ecosystems  (medium confidence). This will lead to a decline in the biomass of abyssal meio- and macrofauna (by 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014) by −9.8% and −13.0% under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (limited evidence). By 2100, 18.8 ± 19.0% to 38.9 ± 9.4% of the ocean will very likely undergo  a  change  of  more  than  20 d  (advances  and  delays)  in  the start of the phytoplankton growth period under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (low confidence). This altered timing increases the risk of temporal mismatches between plankton blooms and fish spawning seasons  (medium  to  high  confidence)  and  increases  the  risk  of  fish-recruitment  failure  for  species  with  restricted  spawning  locations, especially  in  mid-to-high  latitudes  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere  (low confidence).  Projected  range  shifts  among  marine  species  (medium confidence)  suggest  extirpations  and  strongly  decreasing  tropical biodiversity. At higher latitudes, range expansions will drive increased homogenisation  of  biodiversity.  The  projected  loss  of  biodiversity ultimately  threatens  marine  ecosystem  resilience  (medium  to  high confidence), with subsequent effects on service provisioning (medium to high confidence). {3.2.2.3, 3.4.2.10, 3.4.3.1–3.4.3.5, 3.5, WGI AR6 Section 2.3.4.2.3}Risks  from  sea  level  rise  for  coastal  ecosystems  and  people are  very  likely  to  increase  tenfold  well  before  2100  without adaptation and mitigation action as agreed by Parties to the Paris Agreement  (very  high  confidence).  Sea  level  rise  under  emission scenarios that do not limit warming to 1.5°C will increase the risk of coastal  erosion  and  submergence  of  coastal  land  (high  confidence), loss of coastal habitat and ecosystems (high confidence) and worsen salinisation of groundwater (high confidence), compromising coastal ecosystems  and livelihoods  (high  confidence).  Under  SSP1-2.6, most  coral  reefs  (very  high  confidence),  mangroves  (likely,  medium confidence)  and  salt  marshes  (likely,  medium  confidence)  will  be unable to keep up with sea level rise by 2050, with ecological impacts escalating rapidly beyond 2050, especially for scenarios coupling high emissions with aggressive coastal development (very high confidence). Resultant  decreases in  natural  shoreline  protection  will  place increasing numbers of people at risk (very high confidence). The ability to adapt to current coastal impacts, cope with future coastal risks and prevent further acceleration of sea level rise beyond 2050 depends on immediate implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions (very high  confidence).  {3.4.2.1,  3.4.2.4,  3.4.2.5,  3.4.2.6,  3.5.5.3,  Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3}382Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Climate  change  will  alter  many  ecosystem  services  provided by  marine  systems  (high  confidence),  but  impacts  to  human communities  will  depend  on  people’s  overall  vulnerability, which is strongly influenced by local context and development pathways (very high confidence). Catch composition and diversity of regional fisheries will change (high confidence), and fishers who are able  to  move,  diversify  and  leverage  technology  to  sustain  harvests decrease  their  own  vulnerability  (medium  confidence).  Management that eliminates overfishing facilitates successful future adaptation of fisheries to climate change (very high confidence). Marine-dependent communities, including Indigenous Peoples and local peoples, will be at  increased  risk  of  losing  cultural  heritage  and  traditional  seafood-sourced nutrition (medium confidence). Without adaptation, seafood-dependent people face increased risk of exposure to toxins, pathogens and  contaminants  (high  confidence),  and  coastal  communities face  increasing  risk  from  salinisation  of  groundwater  and  soil  (high confidence).  Early-warning  systems  and  public  education  about environmental  change,  developed  and  implemented  within  the  local and  cultural  context,  can  decrease  those  risks  (high  confidence). Coastal  development  and  management  informed  by  sea  level  rise projections will reduce the number of people and amount of property at  risk  (high  confidence),  but  historical  coastal  development  and policies impede change (high confidence). Current financial flows are globally  uneven  and  overall  insufficient  to  meet  the  projected  costs of  climate  impacts  on  coastal  and  marine  social–ecological  systems (very  high  confidence).  Inclusive  governance  that  (a)  accommodates geographically  shifting  marine  life,  (b)  financially  supports  needed human  transformations,  (c)  provides  effective  public  education  and (d) incorporates scientific  evidence,  Indigenous knowledge  and  local knowledge to manage resources sustainably shows greatest promise for decreasing human vulnerability to all of these projected changes in ocean and coastal ecosystem services (very high confidence). {3.5.3, 3.5.5, 3.5.6, 3.6.3, Box 3.4, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3}Solutions, trade-offs, residual risk, decisions and governanceHumans  are  already  adapting  to  climate-driven  changes  in marine systems, and while further adaptations are required even under low-emission scenarios (high confidence), transformative adaptation  will  be  essential  under  high-emission  scenarios (high  confidence).  Low-emission  scenarios  permit  a  wider  array of  feasible,  effective  and  low-risk  nature-based  adaptation  options (e.g.,  restoration,  revegetation,  conservation,  early-warning  systems for  extreme  events  and  public  education)  (high  confidence).  Under high-emission  scenarios,  adaptation  options  (e.g.,  hard  infrastructure for  coastal  protection,  assisted  migration  or  evolution,  livelihood diversification, migration and relocation of people) are more uncertain and  require  transformative  governance  changes  (high  confidence). Transformative  climate  adaptation  will  reinvent institutions  to overcome obstacles arising from historical precedents, reducing current barriers  to  climate  adaptation  in  cultural,  financial  and  governance sectors (high confidence). Without transformation, global inequities will likely increase between regions (high confidence) and conflicts between jurisdictions may emerge and escalate. {3.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.5.3, 3.6, 3.6.2.1, 3.6.3.1, 3.6.3.2, 3.6.3.3, 3.6.4.1, 3.6.4.2, 3.6.5, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2}Available  adaptation  options  are  unable  to  offset  climate-change  impacts  on  marine  ecosystems  and  the  services  they provide (high confidence). Adaptation solutions implemented at appropriate scales, when combined with ambitious and urgent mitigation  measures,  can  meaningfully  reduce  impacts  (high confidence).  Increasing  evidence  from  implemented  adaptations indicates  that  multi-level  governance,  early-warning  systems  for climate-associated  marine  hazards,  seasonal  and  dynamic  forecasts, habitat  restoration,  ecosystem-based  management,  climate-adaptive management  and  sustainable  harvesting  tend  to  be  both  feasible and  effective  (high  confidence).  Marine  protected  areas  (MPAs),  as currently implemented, do not confer resilience against warming and heatwaves  (medium  confidence)  and  are  not  expected  to  provide substantial  protection  against  climate  impacts  past  2050  (high confidence). However, MPAs can contribute substantially to adaptation and  mitigation  if  they  are  designed  to  address  climate  change, strategically  implemented  and  well  governed  (high  confidence). Habitat  restoration  limits  climate-change-related  loss  of  ecosystem services, including biodiversity, coastal protection, recreational use and tourism (medium confidence), provides mitigation benefits on local to regional scales (e.g., via carbon-storing ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems) (high confidence)  and  may  safeguard  fish-stock  production  in  a  warmer climate  (limited  evidence).  Ambitious  and  swift  global  mitigation offers more adaptation options and pathways to sustain ecosystems and their services (high confidence). {3.4.2, 3.4.3.3, 3.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.5.4, 3.5.5.5, 3.6.2.1, 3.6.2.2, 3.6.2.3, 3.6.3.1, 3.6.3.2, 3.6.3.3, 3.6.5, Figure 3.24, Figure 3.25}Nature-based  solutions  for  adaptation  of  ocean  and  coastal ecosystems can achieve multiple benefits when well designed and  implemented  (high  confidence),  but  their  effectiveness declines  without  ambitious  and  urgent  mitigation  (high confidence).  Nature-based  solutions,  such  as  ecosystem-based management,  climate-smart  conservation  approaches  (i.e.,  climate-adaptive  fisheries  and  conservation)  and  coastal  habitat  restoration, can be cost-effective and generate social, economic and cultural co-benefits while contributing to the conservation of marine biodiversity and  reducing  cumulative  anthropogenic  drivers  (high  confidence). The  effectiveness  of  nature-based  solutions  declines  with  warming; conservation and restoration alone will be insufficient to protect coral reefs beyond 2030 (high confidence) and to protect mangroves beyond the 2040s (high confidence). The multidimensionality of climate-change impacts and their interactions with other anthropogenic stressors calls for integrated approaches that identify trade-offs and synergies across sectors and scales in space and time to build resilience of ocean and coastal  ecosystems  and  the  services  they  deliver  (high  confidence). {3.4.2,  3.5.2,  3.5.3,  3.5.5.3,  3.5.5.4,  3.5.5.5,  3.6.2.2,  3.6.3.2,  3.6.5, Figure 3.25, Table 3.SM.6}Ocean-focused adaptations, especially those that employ nature-based  solutions,  address  existing  inequalities,  and  incorporate just and inclusive decision-making and implementation processes, support  the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  (high confidence).  There  are  predominantly  positive  synergies  between adaptation  options  for  Life  Below  Water  (SDG14),  Climate  Action (SDG13) and social, economic and governance SDGs (SDG1–12, 16–17) (high confidence), but the ability of ocean adaptation to contribute to the 3383Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesSDGs is constrained by the degree of mitigation action (high confidence). Furthermore,  existing  inequalities  and  entrenched  practices  limit effective and just responses to climate change in coastal communities (high  confidence).  Momentum  is  growing  towards  transformative international and regional governance that will support comprehensive, equitable  ocean  and  coastal  adaptation  while  also  achieving  SDG14 (robust  evidence),  without  compromising  achievement  of  other  SDGs. {3.6.4.0, 3.6.4.2, 3.6.4.3, Figure 3.26}.3384Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 33.1 Point of DepartureThe  ocean  contains  approximately  97%  of  Earth’s  water  within  a system of interconnected basins that cover 71% of its surface. Coastal systems  mostly  extend  seaward  from  the  high-water  mark,  or  just beyond, to the edge of the continental shelf and include shores of soft sediments, rocky shores and reefs, embayments, estuaries, deltas and shelf systems. Oceanic systems comprise waters beyond the shelf edge, from ~200 m to nearly 11,000 m deep (Stewart and Jamieson, 2019), with an average depth of approximately 3700 m. The epipelagic zone, or upper 200 m of the ocean, is illuminated by sufficient sunlight to sustain photosynthesis that supports the rich marine food web. Below the epipelagic zone lies the barely lit mesopelagic zone (200–1000 m), the  perpetually  dark  bathypelagic  zone  (depth  &gt;1000 m)  and  the deep  seafloor  (benthic  ecosystems  at  depths  &gt;200 m),  which  spans rocky and sedimentary habitats on seamounts, mid-ocean ridges and canyons, abyssal plains and sedimented margins. Semi-enclosed seas (SES) include both coastal and oceanic systems.The  ocean  sustains  life  on  Earth  by  providing  essential  resources and  modulating  planetary  flows  of  energy  and  materials.  Together, harvests from the ocean and inland waters provide more than 20% of dietary animal protein for more than 3.3 billion people worldwide and livelihoods for about 60 million people (FAO, 2020b). The global ocean is  centrally  involved  in  sequestering  anthropogenic  atmospheric  CO2 and recycling many elements, and it regulates the global climate system by  redistributing  heat  and  water  (WGI  AR6  Chapter  9;  Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). The ocean also provides a wealth of aesthetic and cultural resources (Barbier et al., 2011), contains vast biodiversity (Appeltans et al., 2012), supports more animal biomass than on land (Bar-On et al., 2018)  and  produces  at  least  half  the  world’s  photosynthetic  oxygen (Field et al., 1998). Ecosystem services (Annex II: Glossary) delivered by  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems  support  humanity  by  protecting coastlines, providing nutrition and economic opportunities (Figure 3.1; Selig et al., 2019) and providing many intangible benefits. Even though ecosystem  services  and  biodiversity  underpin  human  well-being  and support climate mitigation and adaptation (Pörtner et al., 2021b), there are also ethical arguments for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem functions regardless of the beneficiary (e.g., Taylor et al., 2020). This chapter assesses the impact of climate change on the full spectrum of ocean and coastal ecosystems, on their services and on related human activities,  and  it  assesses  marine-related  opportunities  within  both ecological and social systems to adapt to climate change.Previous  IPCC Assessment  Reports  (IPCC,  2014b;  IPCC,  2014c;  IPCC, 2018;  IPCC,  2019b)  have  expressed  growing  confidence  in  the detection of climate-change impacts in the ocean and their attribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Heat and CO2 taken up by the ocean (high to very high confidence) (IPCC, 2021b) directly affect marine systems, and the resultant “climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) (e.g., ocean temperature and heatwaves, sea level, dissolved oxygen levels, acidification;  Annex  II:  Glossary,  WGI  Figure  SPM.9;  IPCC,  2021b) 3Estimated relative human dependence on marine ecosystemsRelativedependence for:Coastal protectionNutritional dependencedencependenceEconomic dependenceependenceOverall dependenceFigure 3.1 |  Estimated relative human dependence on marine ecosystems for coastal protection, nutrition, fisheries economic benefits and overall. Each bar represents an index value that semi-quantitatively integrates the magnitude, vulnerability to loss and substitutability of the benefit. Indices synthesize information on people’s consumption  of  marine  protein  and  nutritional  status,  gross  domestic  product,  fishing  revenues,  unemployment,  education,  governance  and  coastal  characteristics.  Overall dependence is the mean of the three index values after standardisation from 0–1. (Details regarding component indices are found in Table 1 and Supplementary Material of Selig et al., 2019.) The overall index does not include the economic benefits from tourism or other ocean industries, and data limitations prevented including artisanal or recreational fisheries or the protective impact of salt marshes (Selig et al., 2019). Values for reference regions established in the WGI AR6 Atlas (Gutiérrez et al., 2021) were computed as area-weighted means from original country-level data (Table S6 in Selig et al., 2019).3853Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesalso influence ocean and coastal systems (Section 3.2; Cross-Chapter Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3;  Cross-Chapter  Box  EXTREMES  in  Chapter  2; Figure  3.SM.1),  from  individual  biophysical  processes  to  dependent human  activities.  Several  marine  outcomes  of  CIDs  are  themselves drivers  of  ecological  change  (e.g.,  climate  velocities,  stratification, sea  ice  changes). This  chapter  updates  and  extends  the  assessment of  SROCC  (IPCC,  2019b)  and  WGI  AR6  by  assessing  the  ecosystem effects of the CIDs in WGI AR6 Figure SPM.9 (IPCC, 2021b) and their biologically relevant marine outcomes (detailed in Section 3.2), which are referred to collectively hereafter as ‘climate-induced drivers’4.Detrimental  human  impacts  on  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems  are  not only  caused  by  climate.  Other  anthropogenic  activities  are  increasingly affecting  the  physical,  chemical  and  biological  conditions  of  the  ocean (Doney, 2010; Halpern et al., 2019), and these ‘non-climate drivers5’ also alter marine ecosystems and their services. Fishing and other extractive activities are major non-climate drivers in many ocean and coastal systems (Steneck and Pauly, 2019). Many activities, such as coastal development, shoreline hardening and habitat destruction, physically alter marine spaces (Suchley and Alvarez-Filip, 2018; Ducrotoy et al., 2019; Leo et al., 2019; Newton et al., 2020; Raw et al., 2020). Other human activities decrease water  quality  by  overloading  coastal  water  with  terrestrial  nutrients (eutrophication) and by releasing runoff containing chemical, biological and  physical  pollutants,  toxins,  and  pathogens  (Jambeck  et  al.,  2015; Luek et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Froelich and Daines, 2020). Some human  activities  disturb  marine  organisms  by  generating  excess  noise and light (Davies et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2021), while others decrease natural  light  penetration  into  the  ocean  (Wollschläger  et  al.,  2021). Several anthropogenic activities alter processes that span the land–sea interface  by  changing  coastal  hydrology  or  causing  coastal  subsidence (Michael et al., 2017; Phlips et al., 2020; Bagheri-Gavkosh et al., 2021). Atmospheric pollutants can harm marine systems or unbalance natural marine processes (Doney et al., 2007; Hagens et al., 2014; Lamborg et al., 2014;  Ito  et  al.,  2016).  Organisms  frequently  experience  non-climate drivers  simultaneously  with  climate-induced  drivers  (Section  3.4),  and feedbacks  may  exist  between  climate-induced  drivers  and  non-climate drivers that enhance the effects of climate change (Rocha et al., 2015; Ortiz et al., 2018; Wolff et al., 2018; Cabral et al., 2019; Bowler et al., 2020; Gissi et al., 2021). SROCC assessed with high confidence that reduction of  pollution  and  other  stressors,  along  with  protection,  restoration  and precautionary  management,  supports  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems and  their  services  (IPCC,  2019b). This  chapter  examines  the  combined influence of climate-induced drivers and primary non-climate drivers on many ecosystems assessed.Detecting  changes  and  attributing  them  to  specific  drivers  has  been especially  difficult  in  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems  because  drivers, responses  and  scales  (temporal,  spatial,  organisational)  often  overlap and interact (IPCC, 2014b; IPCC, 2014c; Abram et al., 2019; Gissi et al., 2021).  In  addition,  some  marine  systems  have  short,  heterogeneous or  geographically  biased  observational  records,  which  exacerbate  the interpretation  challenge  (Beaulieu  et  al.,  2013;  Christian,  2014;  Huggel et al., 2016; Benway et al., 2019). It is even more challenging to detect and  attribute  climate  impacts  on  marine-dependent  human  systems, where culture, governance and society also strongly influence observed outcomes. To assess climate-driven change in natural and social systems robustly,  IPCC  reports  rely  on  multiple  lines  of  evidence,  and  the available types of evidence differ depending on the system under study (Section  1.3.2.1,  Cross-Working  Group  Box  ATTRIB).  Lines  of  evidence used for ocean and coastal ecosystems for this and previous assessments include  observed  phenomena,  laboratory  and  field  experiments,  long-term  monitoring,  empirical  and  dynamical  model  analyses,  Indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK), and paleorecords (IPCC, 2014b; IPCC, 2014c; IPCC, 2019b). The growing body of climate research for ocean and coastal ecosystems and their services increasingly provides multiple independent  lines  of  evidence  whose  conclusions  support  each  other, raising the overall confidence in detection and attribution of impacts over time (Section 1.3.2.1, Cross-Working Group Box ATTRIB in Chapter 3).Natural  adaptation  to  climate  change  in  ocean  and  coastal  systems includes  an  array  of  responses  taking  place  at  scales  from  cells  to ecosystems.  Previous  IPCC  assessments  have  established  that  many marine  species  ‘have  shifted  their  geographic  ranges,  seasonal activities,  migration  patterns,  abundances  and  species  interactions in  response  to  climate  change’  (high  confidence)  (IPCC,  2014b; IPCC, 2014c), which has had global impacts on species composition, abundance  and  biomass,  and  on  ecosystem  structure  and  function (medium confidence) (IPCC, 2019b). Warming and acidification have affected coastal ecosystems in concert with non-climate drivers (high confidence), which have affected habitat area, biodiversity, ecosystem function  and  services  (high  confidence)  (IPCC,  2019b).  Confidence has grown in these assessments over time as observational datasets have  lengthened  and  other  lines  of  evidence  have  corroborated observations. AR5 and SROCC assessed how physiological sensitivity to  climate-induced  drivers  is  the  underlying  cause  of  most  marine organisms’  vulnerability  to  climate  (high  confidence)  (Pörtner  et  al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019a). Since those assessments, more evidence supports the empirical physiological models of tolerance and plasticity (Sections 3.3.2, 3.3.4) and of interactions among multiple (climate and non-climate) drivers at individual to ecosystem scales (Sections 3.3.3, 3.4.5).  New  experimental  evidence  about  evolutionary  adaptation (Section 3.3.4) bolsters previous assessments that adaptation options to  climate  change  are  limited  for  eukaryotic  organisms.  Tools  such as  ecosystem  models  can  now  constrain  probable  ecosystem  states (Sections 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4). Observations have increased understanding of how extreme events affect individuals, populations and ecosystems, helping refine understanding of both ecological tolerance to climate impacts and ecological transformations (Section 3.4).Human  adaptation  to  climate  impacts  on  ocean  and  coastal  systems spans  a  variety  of  actions  that  change  human  activity  to  maintain that  coastal marine  ecosystem  services.  After  AR5  concluded adaptation  could  reduce  the  effects  of  climate  impacts  on  coastal human  communities  (high  agreement, limited  evidence)  (Wong  et  al., 2014),  SROCC  confirmed  that  mostly  risk-reducing  ocean  and  coastal adaptation responses were underway (Bindoff et al., 2019a). However, 4  We henceforth use the term ‘climate-induced drivers’ in reference to all drivers of ecological change that are related directly to climate change (IPCC, 2021a) as well as those that emerge in response to CIDs.5  We henceforth use the term ‘non-climate drivers’ in reference to drivers of ecological change that are not caused by climate change.386Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 3.1 | How do we know which changes to marine ecosystems are specifically caused by climate change?To attribute changes in marine ecosystems to human-induced climate change, scientists use paleorecords (reconstructing the links between climate, evolutionary and ecological changes in the geological past), contemporary observations (assessing current climate and ecological responses in the field and through experiments) and models. We refer to these as multiple lines of evidence, meaning that the evidence comes from diverse approaches, as described below.Emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from human activity cause ocean warming, acidification, oxygen loss, and other physical and chemical changes that are affecting marine ecosystems around the world. At the same time, natural climate variability and direct human impacts, such as overfishing and pollution, also affect marine ecosystems locally, regionally and globally. These climate and non-climate impact drivers counteract each other, add up or multiply to produce smaller or larger changes than expected from individual drivers. Attribution of changes in marine ecosystems requires evaluating the often-interacting roles of natural climate variability, non-climate drivers, and human-induced climate change. To do this work, scientists use•  paleorecords: reconstructing the links between climate and evolutionary and ecological changes of the past;•  contemporary observations: assessing current climate and ecological responses;•  manipulation experiments: measuring responses of organisms and ecosystems to different climate conditions; and•  models: testing whether we understand how organisms and ecosystems are impacted by different stressors, and quantifying the relative importance of different stressors.Paleorecords can be used to trace the correlation between past changes in climate and marine life. Paleoclimate is reconstructed from the chemical composition of shells and teeth or from sediments and ice cores. Changes to sea life signalled by changing biodiversity, extinction or distributional shifts are reconstructed from fossils. Using large datasets, we can infer the effects of climate change on sea life over relatively long time scalesusually hundreds to millions of years. The advantage of paleorecords is that they provide insights into how climate change affects life from organisms to ecosystems, without the complicating influence of direct human impacts. A key drawback is that the paleo and modern worlds do not have fully comparable paleoclimate regimes, dominant marine species and rates of climate change. Nevertheless, the paleorecord can be used to derive fundamental rules by which organisms, ecosystems, environments and regions are typically most affected by climate change. For example, the paleorecord shows that coral reefs repeatedly underwent declines during past warming events, supporting the inference that corals may not be able to adapt to current climate warming.⎯Contemporary  observations  over  recent  decades  allow  scientists  to  relate  the  status  of  marine  species  and ecosystems  to  changes  in  climate  or  other  factors.  For  example,  scientists  compile  large  datasets  to  determine whether species usually associated with warm water are appearing in traditionally cool-water areas that are rapidly warming.  A  similar  pattern  observed  in  multiple  regions  and  over  several  decades  (i.e.,  longer  than  time  scales of  natural  variability)  provides  confidence  that  climate  change  is  altering  community  structure.  This  evidence  is weighed against findings from other approaches, such as manipulation experiments, to provide a robust picture of climate-change impacts in the modern ocean.In  manipulation  experiments,  scientists  expose  organisms  or  communities  of  organisms  to  multiple  stressors,  for example, elevated CO2, high temperature, or both, based on values drawn from future climate projections. Such experiments will involve multiple treatments (e.g., in different aquarium tanks) in which organisms are exposed to different combinations of the stressors. This approach enables scientists to understand the effects of individual stressors  as  well  as  their  interactions  to  explore  physiological  thresholds  of  marine  organisms  and  communities. The scale of manipulation experiments can range from small tabletop tanks to large installations or natural ocean experiments involving tens of thousands of litres of water.Ecological effects of climate change are also explored within models developed from fundamental scientific principles and observations. Using these numerical representations of marine ecosystems, scientists can explore how different levels  of  climate  change  and  non-climate  stressors  influence  species  and  ecosystems  at  scales  not  possible  with experiments. Models are commonly used to simulate the ecological response to climate change over recent decades and centuries. Convergence between the model results and the observations suggests that our understanding of the key processes is sufficient to attribute the observed ecological changes to climate change, and to use the models to project future ecological changes. Differences between model results and observations indicate gaps in knowledge to be filled in order to better detect and attribute the impacts of climate change on marine life.3387Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox FAQ 3.1 (continued)Using  peer-reviewed  research  spanning  the  full  range  of  scientific  approaches  (paleorecords,  observations, experiments  and  models),  we  can  assess  the  level  of  confidence  in  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  observed modifications in marine ecosystems. We refer to this as multiple lines of evidence, meaning that the evidence comes from the diverse approaches described above. This allows policymakers and managers to address the specific actions needed to reduce climate change and other impacts.Examples of well-known impacts of anthropogenic climate changeImpactsEvidence of impactsCoral reefsPaleorecordObservationsExperimentsModel3MangrovesBeachesCoralBleachingMangrovediebackBeacherosionExamples ofnature-based adaptationsolutionsRestoration and conservationRestoration and conservationRecovery of sand dunesFisheriesSpecies shiftsEcosystem-basedmanagementEvidence availabilityRobustMediumLimitedFigure FAQ3.1.1 |  Examples of well-known impacts of anthropogenic climate change and associated nature-based adaptation. To attribute changes in marine ecosystems to anthropogenic climate change, scientists use multiple lines of evidence including paleorecords, contemporary observations, manipulation experiments and models.388Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3overlapping climate-induced drivers and non-climate drivers confound implementation  and  assessment  of  the  success  of  marine  adaptation, revealing the complexity of attempting to maintain marine ecosystems and services through adaptation. SROCC assessed with high confidence that while the benefits of many locally implemented adaptations exceed their  disadvantages,  others  are  marginally  effective  and  have  large disadvantages, and overall, adaptation has a limited ability to reduce the probable risks from climate change, being at best a temporary solution (Bindoff et al., 2019a). SROCC also concluded that a portfolio of many different types of adaptation actions, effective and inclusive governance, and  mitigation  must  be  combined  for  successful  adaptation  (Bindoff et al., 2019a). The portfolio of adaptation measures has now been defined (Section 3.6.2), and individual and combined adaptation solutions have been implemented in several marine sectors (Section 3.6.3). Delays in marine  adaptation  have  been  partly  attributed  to  the  complexity  of ocean governance (Section 3.6.4; Cross-Chapter Box 3 and Figure CB3.1 in Abram  et  al.,  2019)  and  to  the  low  priority  accorded  the  ocean  in international development goals (Nash et al., 2020), but in recent years the  ocean  is  being  increasingly  incorporated  in  international  climate policy and multilateral environmental agreements (Section 3.6.4).This  chapter  assesses  the  current  understanding  of  climate-induced drivers,  ecological  vulnerability  and  adaptability,  risks  to  coastal and  ocean  ecosystems,  and  human  vulnerability  and  adaptation to  resulting  changes  in  ocean  benefits,  now  and  in  the  future (Figure 3.2). It starts by assessing the biologically relevant outcomes of  anthropogenic  climate-induced  drivers  (Section  3.2).  Next,  it sets  out  the  mechanisms  that  determine  the  responses  of  ocean and coastal organisms to individual and combined drivers from the genetic to the ecosystem level (Section 3.3). This supports a detailed assessment of the observed and projected responses of coastal and ocean ecosystems to these hazards, placing them in context using the paleorecord (Section 3.4). These observed and projected impacts are used  to  quantify  consequent  risks  to  delivery  of  ecosystem  services and the socioeconomic sectors that depend on them, with attention to  the  vulnerability,  resilience  and  adaptive  capacity  of  social–ecological systems (Section 3.5). The chapter concludes by assessing the state of adaptation and governance actions available to address these  emerging  threats  while  also  advancing  human  development (Section  3.6).

 IPCC, 2018). This section aims to build on the WGI AR6 assessment (Table 3.2) to provide an ecosystem-oriented framing of CIDs. Updating SROCC, projected trends assessed here are based on a new range of scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs), as used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; Section 1.2.2).3.2.2 Physical Changes-3-2-10123°C century-13.2.2.1  Ocean Warming, Climate Velocities and Marine (b) Climate velocityHeatwaves3Global mean SST has increased since the beginning of the 20th century by  0.88°C  (very  likely  range:  0.68–1.01°C),  and  it  is  virtually  certain that  the  global  ocean  has  warmed  since  at  least  1971  (WGI  AR6 Section  9.2;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021).  A  key  characteristic  of  ocean temperature  change  relevant  for  ecosystems  is  climate  velocity,  a measure  of  the  speed  and  direction  at  which  isotherms  move  under climate change (Burrows et al., 2011), which gives the rate at which species  must  migrate  to  maintain  constant  climate  conditions.  It  has been shown to be a useful and simple predictor of species distribution shifts in marine ecosystems (Chen et al., 2011; Pinsky et al., 2013; Lenoir et  al.,  2020).  Median  climate  velocity  in  the  surface  ocean  has  been 21.7 km per decade since 1960, with higher values in the Arctic/sub-Arctic and within 15° of the Equator (Figure 3.3; Burrows et al., 2011). While climate velocity has been slower in the mesopelagic layer (200–1000 m) than in the epipelagic layer (0–200 m) over the past 50 years, it has been shown to be faster in the bathypelagic (1000–4000 m) and abyssopelagic (&gt;4000 m) layers (Figure 3.4; Brito-Morales et al., 2020), suggesting that deep-ocean species could be as exposed to effects of warming as species in the surface ocean (Brito-Morales et al., 2020).Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are periods of extreme seawater temperature relative to the long-term mean seasonal cycle, that persist for days to months, and that may carry severe consequences for marine ecosystems and  their  services  (WGI  AR6  Box  9.2;  Hobday  et  al.,  2016a;  Smale et  al.,  2019;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021).  MHWs  became  more  frequent over the 20th century (high confidence) and into the beginning of the 21st  century,  approximately  doubling  in  frequency  (high  confidence) and  becoming  more  intense  and  longer  since  the  1980s  (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Box 9.2; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). These trends in MHWs are explained by an increase in ocean mean temperatures (Oliver et  al.,  2018),  and  human  influence  has  very  likely  contributed  to  84–90% of them since at least 2006 (WGI AR6 Box 9.2; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). The probability of occurrence (as well as duration and intensity) of the largest and most impactful MHWs that have occurred in the past 30 years has increased more than 20-fold due to anthropogenic climate change (Laufkötter et al., 2020).392km decade-1-240 -1200120240(c) Change in total marine heatwavesDays-60-40-200204060Figure 3.3 |  Observed surface ocean warming, surface climate velocity and reconstructed changes in marine heatwaves (MHWs) over the past 100 years.

(Data from Oliver et al., 2018).Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Ocean warming will continue over the 21st century (virtually certain), with  the  rate  of  global  ocean  warming  starting  to  be  scenario-dependent  from  about  the  mid-21st  century  (medium  confidence). At  the  ocean  surface,  it  is  virtually  certain  that  SST  will  continue  to increase throughout the 21st century, with increasing hazards to many marine  ecosystems  (WGI AR6  Box  9.2;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021).  The future  global  mean  SST  increase  projected  by  CMIP6  models  for  the period  1995–2014  to  2081–2100  is  0.86°C  (very  likely  range:  0.43–1.47°C) under SSP1-2.6, 1.51°C (1.02–2.19°C) under SSP2-4.5, 2.19°C (1.56–3.30°C) under SSP3-7.0 and 2.89°C (2.01–4.07°C) under SSP5-8.5 (WGI AR6 Section 9.2.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Stronger surface warming occurs in parts of the tropics, in the North Pacific, and in the Arctic Ocean, where SST increases by &gt;4°C in 2080–2099 under SSP5-8.5 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The CMIP6 climate models also project ocean warming at the seafloor, with the magnitude of projected changes being less than that of surface waters but having larger uncertainties (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The projected end-of-the-century warming in CMIP6 as reported here is greater than assessed with Coupled Model Intercomparison  Project  5  (CMIP5)  models  in AR5  and  in  SROCC  for similar radiative forcing scenarios (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020), because  of  greater  climate  sensitivity  in  the  CMIP6  model  ensemble than in CMIP5 (WGI AR6 Chapter 4; Forster et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021).Marine heatwaves will continue to increase in frequency, with a likely global increase of 2–9 times in 2081–2100 compared with 1995–2014 under  SSP1-2.6,  and  3–15  times  under  SSP5-8.5,  with  the  largest increases  in  tropical  and Arctic  oceans  (WGI AR6  Box  9.2;  Frölicher et al., 2018; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).3.2.2.2 Sea Level Rise and Extreme Sea LevelsGlobal mean sea level (GMSL) (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3) has risen by about 0.20 m since 1901 and continues to accelerate (WGI AR6 Section 2.3.3.3; Church and White, 2011; Jevrejeva et al., 2014; Hay  et  al.,  2015;  Kopp  et  al.,  2016;  Dangendorf  et  al.,  2017; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; Kemp et al., 2018; Ablain et al., 2019; Gulev et al., 2021).Most coastal ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, shallow coral reefs, rocky shores and sandy beaches) are affected by changes in relative sea level (RSL, the change in the mean sea level relative to the land; Section 3.4.2). Regional rates of RSL rise differ from the global mean  due  to  a  range  of  factors,  including  local  subsidence  driven by  anthropogenic  activities  such  as  groundwater  and  hydrocarbon extraction (WGI AR6 Box 9.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). In many deltaic regions,  anthropogenic  subsidence  is  currently  the  dominant  driver of RSL rise (WGI AR6 Section 9.6.3.2; Tessler et al., 2018; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). RSL rise is driving a global increase in the frequency of extreme sea levels (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 9.6.4.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).3Historical and projected climate velocityHistoricalSSP1-2.6SSP5-8.5(a)(d)(g)Epipelagic0–200mMesopelagic200–1000mBathypelagic1000–4000m(b)(e)(h)(c)(f)(i)km decade-1-240-1200120240Figure 3.4 |  Historical and projected climate velocity.

All anomalies are model-ensemble averages over 2080–2099 relative to the 1870–1899 baseline period (from Kwiatkowski et al., 2020), except for sea level, which shows model-ensemble median in 2100 relative to 1901 (from AR6 WGI Chapter 9). Error bars represent very likely ranges, except for SLR where they represent likely ranges. Very likely ranges for pH changes are too narrow to appear in the figure (see text). Panels (e,f,g,h) show regions where end-of-century projected CMIP6 surface warming exceeds 2°C, where surface ocean pH decline exceeds 0.3, where subsurface dissolved oxygen decline exceeds 30 mmol m-3 and where euphotic-zone (0–100 m) nitrate decline exceeds 1 mmol m-3 in (e) SSP1-2.6, (f) SSP2-4.5,  (g) SSP3-7.0 and (h) SSP5-8.5. All anomalies are 2080–2099 relative to the 1870–1899 baseline period. (Modified from Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).GMSL  rise  through  the  middle  of  the  21st  century  exhibits  limited dependence  on  emissions  scenario;  between  1995–2014  and  2050, GMSL is likely to rise by 0.15–0.23 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.20–0.30 m under  SSP5-8.5  (WGI  AR6  Section  9.6.3;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021). Beyond 2050, GMSL and RSL projections are increasingly sensitive to the differences among emission scenarios. Considering only processes in which there is at least medium confidence (e.g., thermal expansion, land-water storage, land-ice surface mass balance and some ice-sheet dynamic processes), GMSL between 1995–2014 and 2100 is likely to rise  by  0.28–0.55 m  under  SSP1-1.9,  0.33–0.61 m  under  SSP1-2.6, 0.44–0.76 m under SSP2-4.5, 0.55–0.90 m under SSP3-7.0 and 0.63–1.02 m under SSP5-8.5 (Figure 3.5). Under high-emission scenarios, ice-sheet processes in which there is low confidence and deep uncertainty might contribute more than one additional metre to GMSL rise by 2100 (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).394 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Rising mean RSL will continue to drive an increase in the frequency of extreme  sea  levels  (high  confidence). The  expected  frequency  of  the current 1-in-100-year extreme sea level is projected to increase by a median of 20–30 times across tide-gauge sites by 2050, regardless of emission scenario (medium confidence). In addition, extreme-sea-level frequency may be affected by changes in tropical cyclone climatology (low confidence), wave climatology (low confidence) and tides (high confidence) associated with climate change and sea level change (WGI AR6 Section 9.6.4.2; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).3.2.2.3 Changes in Ocean Circulation, Stratification and Coastal UpwellingOcean  circulation  and  its  variations  are  key  to  the  evolution  of  the physical,  chemical  and  biological  properties  of  the  ocean.  Vertical mixing  and  upwelling  are  critical  factors  affecting  the  supply  of nutrients  to  the  sunlit  ocean  and  hence  the  magnitude  of  primary productivity. Ocean currents not only transport heat, salt, carbon and nutrients, but they also control the dispersion of many organisms and the connectivity between distant populations.Ocean stratification is an important factor controlling biogeochemical cycles  and  affecting  marine  ecosystems.  WGI  AR6  Section  9.2.1.3 (Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021)  assessed  that  it  is  virtually  certain  that stratification  in  the  upper  200 m  of  the  ocean  has  been  increasing since  1970.  Recent  evidence  has  strengthened  estimates  of  the  rate of change (Yamaguchi and Suga, 2019; Li et al., 2020a; Sallée et al., 2021),  with  an  estimated  increase  of  1.0  ±  0.3%  (very  likely  range) per  decade  over  the  period  1970–2018  (high  confidence)  (WGI AR6 Section  9.2.1.3;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021),  higher  than  assessed  in SROCC.  It  is  very  likely  that  stratification  in  the  upper  few  hundred metres of the ocean will increase substantially in the 21st century in all ocean basins, driven by intensified surface warming and near-surface freshening at high latitudes (WGI AR6 Section 9.2.1.3; Capotondi et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2016; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).Contrasting  changes  among  the  major  eastern  boundary  coastal upwelling  systems  (EBUS)  were  identified  in  AR5  (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). While SROCC assessed with high confidence that three (Benguela, Peru-Humboldt, California) out of the four major EBUS have experienced  upwelling-favourable  wind  intensification  in  the  past 60 years (Sydeman et al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019a), WGI AR6 revisited this assessment based on evidence showing low agreement between studies that have investigated trends over past decades (Varela et al., 2015). WGI AR6 assessed that only the California Current system has undergone large-scale upwelling-favourable wind intensification since the  1980s  (medium  confidence)  (WGI  AR6  Section  9.2.1.5;  García-Reyes and Largier, 2010; Seo et al., 2012; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).While  no  consistent  pattern  of  contemporary  changes  in  upwelling-favourable winds emerges from observation-based studies, numerical and theoretical work projects that summertime winds near poleward boundaries  of  upwelling  zones  will  intensify,  while  winds  near equatorward  boundaries  will  weaken  (high  confidence)  (WGI  AR6 Section  9.2.3.5;  García-Reyes  et  al.,  2015;  Rykaczewski  et  al.,  2015; Wang  et  al.,  2015;  Aguirre  et  al.,  2019;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021). Nevertheless,  projected  future  annual  cumulative  upwelling  wind changes  at  most  locations  and  seasons  remain  within  ±10–20%  of present-day  values  (medium  confidence)  (WGI  AR6  Section  9.2.3.5; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).Continuous  observation  of  the  Atlantic  meridional  overturning circulation (AMOC) has improved the understanding of its variability (Frajka-Williams  et  al.,  2019),  but  there  is  low  confidence  in  the quantification of AMOC changes in the 20th century because of low agreement  in  quantitative  reconstructed  and  simulated  trends  (WGI AR6 Sections 2.3.3, 9.2.3.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021). Direct observational records since the mid-2000s remain too short to determine  the  relative  contributions  of  internal  variability,  natural forcing and anthropogenic forcing to AMOC change (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Sections 2.3.3, 9.2.3.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021). Over the 21st century, AMOC will very likely decline for all SSP scenarios  but  will  not  involve  an  abrupt  collapse  before  2100  (WGI AR6 Sections 4.3.2, 9.2.3.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021).3.2.2.4 Sea Ice Changes3Sea ice is a key driver of polar marine life, hosting unique ecosystems and  affecting  diverse  marine  organisms  and  food  webs  through  its impact  on  light  penetration  and  supplies  of  nutrients  and  organic matter  (Arrigo,  2014).  Since  the  late  1970s, Arctic  sea  ice  area  has decreased for all months, with an estimated decrease of 2 million km2 (or  25%)  for  summer  sea  ice  (averaged  for August,  September  and October)  in  2010–2019  as  compared  with  1979–1988  (WGI  AR6 Section 9.3.1.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). For Antarctic sea ice there is no significant global trend in satellite-observed sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 in either winter or summer, due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability (WGI AR6 Section 9.3.2.1; Maksym, 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).CMIP6  simulations  project  that  the Arctic  Ocean  will  likely  become practically sea ice free (area below 1 million km2) for the first time before 2050 and in the seasonal sea ice minimum in each of the four emission scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 3.7; WGI AR6 Section 9.3.2.2; Notze and SIMIP Community, 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Antarctic sea ice area is also projected to decrease during the 21st century, but due to mismatches between model simulations and observations, combined with a lack of understanding of reasons for  substantial  inter-model  spread,  there  is  low  confidence  in  model projections  of  future  Antarctic  sea  ice  changes,  particularly  at  the regional  level  (WGI  AR6  Section  9.3.2.2;  Roach  et  al.,  2020;  Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).3.2.3 Chemical Changes3.2.3.1   Ocean AcidificationThe  ocean’s  uptake  of  anthropogenic  carbon  affects  its  chemistry in  a  process  referred  to  as  ocean  acidification,  which  increases  the concentrations of aqueous CO2, bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, and decreases  pH,  carbonate  ion  concentrations  and  calcium  carbonate mineral  saturation  states  (Doney  et  al.,  2009).  Ocean  acidification 3953Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesaffects  a  variety  of  biological  processes  with,  for  example,  lower calcium  carbonate  saturation  states  reducing  net  calcification  rates for  some  shell-forming  organisms  and  higher  CO2  concentrations increasing  photosynthesis  for  some  phytoplankton  and  macroalgal species (Section 3.3.2).Direct measurements of ocean acidity from ocean time series, as well as pH changes determined from other shipboard studies, show consistent decreases  in  ocean  surface  pH  over  the  past  few  decades  (virtually certain) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.2.2; Takahashi et al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Sutton et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021).Since the 1980s, surface ocean pH has declined by a very likely rate of  0.016–0.020  per  decade  in  the  subtropics  and  0.002–0.026  per decade  in  the  subpolar  and  polar  zones  (WGI  AR6  Section  5.3.2.2; Canadell et al., 2021). Typically, the pH of global surface waters has decreased  from  8.2  to  8.1  since  the  pre-industrial  era  (1750  CE),  a trend  attributable  to  rising  atmospheric  CO2  (virtually  certain)  (Orr et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2019).Ocean acidification is also developing in the ocean interior (very high confidence)  due  to  the  transport  of  anthropogenic  CO2  to  depth  by ocean currents and mixing (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.1; Canadell et al., 2021). There, it leads to the shoaling of saturation horizons of aragonite and calcite (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.1; Canadell et al., 2021), below which dissolution of these calcium carbonate minerals is  thermodynamically  favoured.  The  calcite  or  aragonite  saturation horizons have migrated upwards in the North Pacific (1–2 m yr–1 over 1991–2006) (Feely et al., 2012) and in the Irminger Sea (10–15 m yr–1 for  the  aragonite  saturation  horizon  over  1991–2016)  (Perez  et  al., 2018).  In  some  locations  of  the  western  Atlantic  Ocean,  calcite saturation  depth  has  risen  by  ~300 m  since  the  pre-industrial  era due  to  increasing  concentrations  of  deep-ocean  dissolved  inorganic carbon (Sulpis et al., 2018). In the Arctic, where some coastal surface waters  are  already  undersaturated  with  respect  to  aragonite  due  to the  degradation  of  terrestrial  organic  matter  (Mathis  et  al.,  2015; Semiletov et al., 2016), the deep aragonite saturation horizon shoaled on average 270 ± 60 m during 1765–2005 (Terhaar et al., 2020).Detection and attribution of ocean acidification in coastal environments are more difficult than in the open ocean due to larger spatio-temporal variability  of  carbonate  chemistry  (Duarte  et  al.,  2013;  Laruelle et al., 2017; Torres et al., 2021) and to the influence of other natural acidification  drivers  such  as  freshwater  and  high-nutrient  riverine inputs  (Cai  et  al.,  2011;  Laurent  et  al.,  2017;  Fennel  et  al.,  2019;  Cai et  al.,  2020)  or  anthropogenic  acidification  drivers  (Section  3.1)  like atmospherically  deposited  nitrogen  and  sulphur  (Doney  et  al.,  2007; Hagens  et  al.,  2014).  Since  AR5,  the  observing  network  in  coastal oceans has expanded substantially, improving understanding of both the drivers and amplitude of observed variability (Sutton et al., 2016). Recent studies indicate that two more decades of observations may be required before anthropogenic ocean acidification emerges over natural variability in some coastal sites and regions (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.5.2; Sutton et al., 2019; Turk et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021).Mean open-ocean surface pH is projected to decline by 0.08 ± 0.003 (very likely range), 0.17 ± 0.003, 0.27 ± 0.005 and 0.37 ± 0.007 pH units  in  2081–2100  relative  to  1995–2014,  for  SSP1-2.6,  SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (Figure 3.5; WGI AR6 Section 4.3.2; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). Projected changes in surface pH  are  relatively  uniform  in  contrast  with  those  of  other  surface-ocean variables, but they are largest in the Arctic Ocean (Figure 3.6; WGI AR6  Section  5.3.4.1;  Canadell  et  al.,  2021).  Similar  declines  in the  concentration  of  carbonate  ions  are  projected  by  Earth  system models  (ESMs;  Bopp  et  al.,  2013;  Gattuso  et  al.,  2015;  Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean regions  will  become  undersaturated  for  calcium  carbonate  minerals first (Orr et al., 2005; Pörtner et al., 2014). Concurrent impacts on the seasonal amplitude of carbonate chemistry variables are anticipated (i.e.,  increased  amplitude  for  pCO2  and  hydrogen  ions,  decreased amplitude  for  carbonate  ions;  McNeil  and  Sasse,  2016;  Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).Future  declines  in  subsurface  pH  (Figure  3.6)  will  be  modulated  by changes in ocean overturning and water-mass subduction (Resplandy et al., 2013), and in organic matter remineralisation (Chen et al., 2017). In particular, decreases in pH will be less consistent at the seafloor than at the surface and will be linked to the transport of surface anomalies to  depth.  For  example,  &gt;20%  of  the  North Atlantic  seafloor  deeper than 500 m, including canyons and seamounts designated as marine protected areas (MPAs), will experience pH reductions &gt;0.2 by 2100 under RCP8.5 (Gehlen et al., 2014). Changes in pH in the abyssal ocean (&gt;3000 m deep) are greatest in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, with lesser impacts in the Southern and Pacific Oceans by 2100, mainly due to ventilation time scales (Sweetman et al., 2017).3.2.3.2   Ocean DeoxygenationOcean  deoxygenation,  the  loss  of  oxygen  in  the  ocean,  results  from ocean warming, through a reduction in oxygen saturation, increased oxygen  consumption,  increased  ocean  stratification  and  ventilation changes  (Keeling  et  al.,  2010;  IPCC,  2019a).  In  recent  decades, anthropogenic inputs of nutrients and organic matter (Section 3.1) have increased the extent, duration and intensity of coastal hypoxia events worldwide (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Rabalais et al., 2010; Breitburg et al., 2018), while pollution-induced atmospheric deposition of soluble iron  over  the  ocean  has  accelerated  open-ocean  deoxygenation  (Ito et al., 2016). Deoxygenation and acidification often coincide because biological consumption of oxygen produces CO2. Deoxygenation can have a range of detrimental effects on marine organisms and reduce the extent of marine habitats (Sections 3.3.2, 3.4.3.1; Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte, 2008; Chu and Tunnicliffe, 2015).Changes  in  ocean  oxygen  concentrations  have  been  analysed  from compilations  of  in  situ  data  dating  back  to  the  1960s  (Helm  et  al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017). SROCC concluded that a  loss  of  oxygen  had  occurred  in  the  upper  1000 m  of  the  ocean (medium confidence), with a global mean decrease of 0.5–3.3% (very likely  range)  over  1970–2010  (Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  Based  on  new regional  assessments  (Queste  et  al.,  2018;  Bronselaer  et  al.,  2020; Cummins  and  Ross,  2020;  Stramma  et  al.,  2020), WGI AR6  assesses that ocean deoxygenation has occurred in most regions of the open ocean since the mid-20th century (high confidence), but it is modified by  climate  variability  on  interannual  and  inter-decadal  time  scales 396Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3(medium  confidence)  (WGI  AR6  Sections  2.3.3.6,  5.3.3.2;  Canadell et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021). New findings since SROCC also confirm that the volume of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding at many locations (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021).The  most  recent  estimates  of  future  oxygen  loss  in  the  subsurface ocean  (100–600 m),  using  CMIP6  models,  amount  to  −4.1  ±  4.2 (very  likely  range),  −6.6  ±  5.7,  −10.1  ±  6.7  and  −11.2  ±  7.7%  in 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and  SSP5-8.5,  respectively  (Figure  3.5;  Kwiatkowski  et  al.,  2020). Based  on  these  CMIP6  projections,  WGI  AR6  concludes  that  the oxygen  content  of  the  subsurface  ocean  is  projected  to  decline  to historically unprecedented conditions over the 21st century (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021). These declines  are  greater  (by  31–72%)  than  simulated  by  the  CMIP5 models in  their  Representative  Concentration  Pathway  (RCP) analogues, a likely consequence of enhanced surface warming and stratification in CMIP6 models (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). At the regional scale and for subsurface waters, projected changes are  not  spatially  uniform,  and  there  is  lower  agreement  among models than they show for the global mean trend (Bopp et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). In particular, large uncertainties remain for these  future  projections  of  ocean  deoxygenation  in  the  subsurface tropical  oceans,  where  the  major  OMZs  are  located  (Cabré  et  al., 2015; Bopp et al., 2017).3.2.3.3   Changes in Nutrient AvailabilityThe availability of nutrients in the surface ocean often limits primary productivity, with implications for marine food webs and the biological carbon  pump.  Nitrogen  availability  tends  to  limit  phytoplankton productivity  throughout  most  of  the  low-latitude  ocean,  whereas dissolved  iron  availability  limits  productivity  in  high-nutrient,  low-chlorophyll regions, such as in the main upwelling region of the Southern Ocean  and  the  Eastern  Equatorial  Pacific  (high  confidence)  (Moore et  al.,  2013;  IPCC,  2019b).  Phosphorus,  silicon,  other  micronutrients such  as  zinc,  and  vitamins  can  also  co-limit  marine  phytoplankton productivity  in  some  ocean  regions  (Moore  et  al.,  2013).  Whereas some  studies  have  shown  coupling  between  climate  variability  and nutrient trends in specific regions, such as in the North Atlantic (Hátún et  al.,  2016),  North  Pacific  (Di  Lorenzo  et  al.,  2009; Yasunaka  et  al., 2014) and tropical (Stramma and Schmidtko, 2021) Oceans, very few studies have been able to detect long-term changes in ocean nutrient concentrations (but see Yasunaka et al., 2016).Future  changes  in  nutrient  concentrations  have  been  estimated using  ESMs,  with  future  increases  in  stratification  generally  leading to  decreased  nutrient  levels  in  surface  waters  (IPCC,  2019b).  CMIP6 models  project  a  decline  in  the  nitrate  concentration  of  the  upper 100 m  in  2080–2099  relative  to  1995–2014  of  −0.46  ±  0.45  (very likely range), −0.60 ± 0.58, −0.80 ± 0.77 and −1.00 ± 0.78 mmol m–3 under  SSP1-2.6,  SSP2-4.5  and  SSP5-8.5,  respectively  (Figure  3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). These declines in nitrate concentration are greater than simulated by the CMIP5 models in their RCP analogues, a likely consequence of enhanced surface warming and stratification in CMIP6 models (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). It is concluded that the surface ocean will encounter reduced nitrate concentrations in the 21st century (medium confidence).3.2.4 Global Synthesis on Multiple Climate-induced DriversIn  the  21st  century,  ocean  and  coastal  ecosystems  are  projected  to face conditions unprecedented over past centuries to millennia (high confidence)  (Section  3.2; WGI AR6  Chapters  4,  9;  Fox-Kemper  et  al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021), with increased temperatures (virtually certain) and frequency and severity of MHWs (very high confidence), stronger upper-ocean  stratification  (high  confidence),  continued  rise  in  GMSL throughout the 21st century (high confidence) and increased frequency of extreme sea levels (high confidence), further acidification (virtually certain),  oxygen  decline  (high  confidence)  and  decreased  surface nitrate inventories (medium confidence).The rates and magnitudes of these changes largely depend on the extent of future emissions (very high confidence), with surface ocean warming and acidification (very likely range) at +3.47°C ± 1.28°C and −0.44 pH units ± 0.008 pH units in 2080–2099 (relative to 1870–1899) for SSP5-8.5 compared with +1.42°C ± 0.53°C and −0.16 pH units ± 0.003 pH units for SSP1-2.6 (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).33.2.4.1   Compound Changes in the 21st centuryEarth  system  models  project  distinct  regional  evolutions  of  the different CIDs over the 21st century (very high confidence) (Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.7; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Tropical and subtropical oceans are characterised by projected warming and acidification, accompanied by declining  nitrate  concentrations  in  equatorial  upwelling  regions. The North Atlantic is characterised by a high exposure to acidification and declining nitrate concentrations. The North Pacific is characterised by high  sensitivity  to  compound  changes,  with  high  rates  of  warming, acidification,  deoxygenation  and  nutrient  depletion.  In  contrast,  the development of compound hazards is limited in the Southern Ocean, where rates of warming and nutrient depletion are lower. The Arctic Ocean  is  characterised  by  the  highest  rates  of  acidification  and warming, strong nutrient depletion, and it will likely become practically sea ice free in the September mean for the first time before the year 2050  in  all  SSP  scenarios  (high  confidence)  (Figures  3.5,  3.6,  3.7; Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3).In general, the projected changes in climate-induced drivers are less in  absolute  terms  in  the  deep-sea  (mesopelagic  and  bathypelagic domains  and  deep-sea  habitats)  than  in  the  surface  ocean  and  in shallow-water  habitats  (e.g.,  kelp  ecosystems,  warm-water  corals) (very high confidence) (Figures 3.6, 3.7; Mora et al., 2013; Sweetman et al., 2017). The mesopelagic domain will be nevertheless exposed to high  rates  of  deoxygenation  (Figure  3.6)  and  high  climate  velocities (Figure  3.4;  Section  3.2.2.1),  as  well  as  impacted  by  the  shoaling  of aragonite  or  calcite  saturation  horizon  (Section  3.2.3.2).  Significant differences in projected trends between the SSPs show that mitigation strategies  will  limit  exposure  of  deep-sea  ecosystems  to  potential warming,  acidification  and  deoxygenation  during  the  21st  century (very high confidence) (Figure 3.6; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).397Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesProjected trends across open-ocean systems(a)(b)(c)(d)3Figure 3.6 |  Projected trends across open-ocean systems. Projected annual and global (a) average warming, (b) acidification, (c) changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations and (d) changes in nitrate (NO3) concentrations for four open-ocean systems, including the epipelagic (0–200 m depth), mesopelagic (200–1000 m), bathypelagic (&gt;1000 m) domains and deep benthic waters (&gt;200 m). All projections are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 models and for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Anomalies in the near-term (2020–2041), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) are all relative to 1985–2014. Error bars represent very likely ranges.398Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 33.2.4.2   Time of EmergenceAnthropogenic  changes  in  climate-induced  drivers  assessed  here exhibit  vastly  distinct  times  of  emergence,  which  is  the  time  scale over  which  an  anthropogenic  signal  related  to  climate  change  is statistically detected to emerge from the background noise of natural Projected trends across coastal-ocean ecosystemsclimate  for  a  specific  region  (Christensen  et  al.,  2007;  Hawkins  and Sutton,  2012).  SROCC  concluded  that  for  ocean  properties,  the  time of emergence ranges from under a decade (e.g., surface ocean pH) to over a century (e.g., net primary production; see Section 3.4.3.3.4 for time of emergence of biological properties; Bindoff et al., 2019a).(a)(b)(c)(d)3(e)Figure 3.7 |  Projected trends across coastal-ocean ecosystems. Projected (a) warming, (b) acidification, (c) changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations, (d) changes in nitrate (NO3) concentrations and (e) changes in summer sea ice cover fraction (September and north of 66°N for the Northern Polar Oceans, and March and south of 66°S for the Southern Polar Ocean) for five coastal-ocean ecosystems. All projected trends are for the surface ocean, except oxygen concentration changes that are computed for the subsurface ocean (100–600 m depth) for the upwelling ecosystems and the polar seas. All projections are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models and for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Anomalies in the near term (2020–2041), mid term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100) are all relative to 1985–2014. Error bars represent very likely ranges. Coastal seas are defined on a 1° × 1° grid when bathymetry is less than 200 m deep. Distribution of warm-water corals is from UNEP-WCMC et al. (2018). Distribution of kelp ecosystems is from OBIS (2020). Upwelling areas are defined according to Rykaczewski et al. (2015).399Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services3The  literature  assessed  in  SROCC  mainly  focused  on  surface  ocean properties  and  gradual  mean  changes.  Since  then,  the  time  of emergence has also been investigated for subsurface properties, ocean extreme events and particularly vulnerable regions, such as the Arctic Ocean  (Hameau  et  al.,  2019;  Oliver  et  al.,  2019;  Burger  et  al.,  2020; Landrum and Holland, 2020; Schlunegger et al., 2020), but subsequent assessments  are  low  confidence  due  to  limited  evidence.  Below the  surface,  changes  in  temperature  typically  emerge  from  internal variability prior to changes in oxygen; however, in about a third of the global thermocline, deoxygenation emerges prior to warming (Hameau et  al.,  2019).  Permanent  MHW  states,  defined  as  when  SST  exceeds the MHW threshold continuously over a full calendar year, will emerge during  the  21st  century  in  many  parts  of  the  surface  ocean  (Oliver et al., 2019). Ocean acidification extremes have already emerged from background natural internal variability during the 20th century in most of the surface ocean (Burger et al., 2020). In the Arctic, anthropogenic sea ice changes have already emerged from the background internal variability,  and  anthropogenic  alteration  of  air  temperatures  will emerge in the early- to mid-21st century (Landrum and Holland, 2020).3.2.4.4   Perspectives from Paleoclimatology DataPaleoclimatology  observations  are  useful  to  assess  multiple  hazards of  environmental  change  while  excluding  direct  anthropogenic impacts (Section 3.4.3.3). Ancient intervals of rapid climate warming that  occurred  between  300  and  50  million  years  ago  (Ma)  were triggered  by  the  release  of  greenhouse  gases  (high  confidence). The sources  of  greenhouse  gases  varied  but  include  volcanic  degassing from  continental  flood  basalts  and  methane  hydrates  stored  in marine sediments and soils (Foster et al., 2018). Six extreme ancient hyperthermal events are known from the last 300 Ma, when tropical SSTs reached 1.5°C–10°C warmer than pre-industrial conditions, and with  substantial  impacts  on  ancient  life  (Cross-Chapter  Box  PALEO in  Chapter  1).  Warming  and  deoxygenation  in  the  oceans  were closely  associated  in  hyperthermal  events  (high  confidence),  with anoxia  reaching  the  photic  zone  and  abyssal  depths  (Kaiho  et  al., 2014; Müller et al., 2017; Penn et al., 2018; Weissert, 2019), whereas ocean acidification has not been demonstrated consistently (medium confidence) (Hönisch et al., 2012; Penman et al., 2014; Clarkson et al., 2015; Harper et al., 2020a; Jurikova et al., 2020; Müller et al., 2020).Greenhouse gases also contributed substantially to shaping the longer-term climate trends over the past 50 million years, although changes in continental configuration and ocean circulation as well as planetary orbital cycles were equally important (WGI AR6 Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 in Chapter 2; Westerhold et al., 2020; Gulev et al., 2021). There is little evidence for ocean acidification in the past 2.6 Ma (low confidence) (Hönisch  et  al.,  2012),  but  ocean  ventilation  was  highly  sensitive  to even  modest  warming  such  as  observed  in  the  past  10,000  years (medium confidence) (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Lembke-Jene et al., 2018).3.3 Linking Biological Responses to Climate-induced Drivers3.3.1 IntroductionThis section assesses new evidence since AR5 (Pörtner et al., 2014) and SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a) regarding biotic responses to multiple environmental drivers. It assesses differential sensitivities among life stages within individual organisms, changing responses across scales of biological organisation and the potential for evolutionary adaptation to  climate  change  (e.g.,  Przeslawski  et  al.,  2015;  Boyd  et  al.,  2018; Reddin et al., 2020), providing examples and identifying key gaps and uncertainties that limit our ability to project the ecological impact of multiple climate-induced drivers (Figure 3.8a). The assessment includes physiological  responses  to  single  environmental  drivers  and  their underlying mechanisms (Section 3.3.2), the characteristics of multiple drivers and organisms’ responses to them (Section 3.3.3), short-term acclimation  and  longer-term  evolutionary  adaptation  of  populations (Section  3.3.4),  and  it  concludes  with  an  assessment  of  progress  in upscaling  laboratory  findings  to  ecosystems  within  in  situ  settings (Figure 3.8b; Section 3.3.5).3.3.2 Responses to Single DriversAnthropogenic  CO2  emissions  trigger  a  suite  of  changes  that  alter ocean temperature, pH and CO2 concentration, oxygen concentration and  nutrient  supply  at  global  scales  (Section  3.2).  The  response pathways  of  these  climate-induced  drivers  have  been  investigated primarily as single variables.Temperature  affects  the  movement  and  transport  of  molecules  and, thereby,  the  rates  of  all  biochemical  reactions;  thus,  ongoing  and projected warming (Section 3.2.2.1) that remains below an organism’s physiological  optimum  will  generally  raise  metabolic  rates  (very high  confidence)  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2014).  Beyond  this  optimum  (Topt; Figure  3.9),  metabolism  typically  decreases  sharply,  finally  reaching a  critical  threshold  (Tcrit)  beyond  which  enzymes  become  thermally inactivated  and  cells  undergo  oxidative  stress.  Local  and  regional adaptation  affect  the  heat  tolerance  thresholds  of  organisms.  For example,  organisms  adapted  to  thermally  stable  environments  (e.g., tropical,  polar,  deep  sea)  are  often  more  sensitive  to  warming  than those  from  thermally  variable  environments  (e.g.,  estuaries)  (very high  confidence)  (Section  3.4;  Sunday  et  al.,  2019;  Collins  et  al., 2020).  Heat  tolerance  also  decreases  with  increasing  organisational complexity (Storch et al., 2014; Pörtner and Gutt, 2016) and is lower in eggs, embryos and spawning fish than for their larval stages or adults outside the spawning season (high confidence) (Dahlke et al., 2020b). By  altering  physiological  responses,  projected  changes  in  ocean warming (Section 3.2.2.1) will modify growth, migration, distribution, competition,  survival  and  reproduction  (very  high  confidence) (Messmer et al., 2017; Dahlke et al., 2018; Andrews et al., 2019; Pinsky et al., 2019; Anton et al., 2020).Altered seawater carbonate chemistry (Section 3.2.3.1) affects specific processes to varying degrees. For example, higher CO2 concentrations can  increase  photosynthesis  and  growth  in  some  phytoplankton, 400Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3macroalgal and seagrass species (high confidence) (Pörtner et al., 2014; Seifert et al., 2020; Zimmerman, 2021), while lower pH levels decrease calcification (high confidence) (Pörtner et al., 2014; Falkenberg et al., 2018;  Doney  et  al.,  2020;  Fox  et  al.,  2020;  Reddin  et  al.,  2020)  or silicification (low confidence) (Petrou et al., 2019). Organisms’ capacity to  compensate  for  or  resist  acidification  of  internal  fluids  depends on  their  capacity  for  acid–base  regulation,  which  differs  due  to organisms’ wide-ranging biological complexity and adaptive abilities (low  to  medium  confidence)  (Vargas  et  al.,  2017;  Melzner  et  al., 2020). Detrimental impacts of acidification include decreased growth and survival, and altered development, especially in early life stages (high confidence) (Dahlke et al., 2018; Onitsuka et al., 2018; Hancock et al., 2020), along with lowered recruitment and altered behaviour in animals (Kroeker et al., 2013a; Wittmann and Pörtner, 2013; Clements and Hunt, 2015; Cattano et al., 2018; Esbaugh, 2018; Bednaršek et al., 2019; Reddin et al., 2020). For finfish, laboratory studies of behavioural and sensory consequences of ocean acidification showed mixed results (Rossi et al., 2018; Nagelkerken et al., 2019; Stiasny et al., 2019; Velez et  al.,  2019;  Clark  et  al.,  2020;  Munday  et  al.,  2020).  Calcifiers  are generally more sensitive to acidification (e.g., for growth and survival) than  non-calcifying  groups  (high  confidence)  (Kroeker  et  al.,  2013a; Wittmann and Pörtner, 2013; Clements and Hunt, 2015; Cattano et al., 2018; Bednaršek et al., 2019; Reddin et al., 2020; Seifert et al., 2020). For calcifying primary producers, including phytoplankton and coralline algae,  ocean  acidification  has  different,  often  opposing  effects,  for example, decreasing calcification while photosynthetic rates increase (high confidence) (Riebesell et al., 2000; Van de Waal et al., 2013; Bach et al., 2015; Cornwall et al., 2017b; Gafar et al., 2019).Oxygen  concentrations  affect  aerobic  and  anaerobic  processes, including energy metabolism and denitrification. Projected decreases in  dissolved  oxygen  concentration  (Section  3.2.3.2)  will  thus  impact organisms  and  their  biogeography  in  ways  dependent  upon  their oxygen  requirements  (Deutsch  et  al.,  2020),  which  are  highest  for large, multicellular organisms (Pörtner et al., 2014). The upper ocean generally  contains  high  dissolved-oxygen  concentrations  due  to air–sea  exchange  and  photosynthesis,  but  in  subsurface  waters, deoxygenation  may  impair  aerobic  organisms  in  multiple  ways (Oschlies et al., 2018; Galic et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2019; Sampaio et  al.,  2021).  Many  processes  contribute  to  lowered  oxygen  levels: altered  ventilation  and  stratification;  microbial  respiration  enhanced by  nearshore  eutrophication;  and  less  oxygen  solubility  in  warmer waters. For example, deoxygenation in highly eutrophic estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems (Section 3.4.2) can result from accelerated microbial  activity,  leading  to  acute  organismal  responses.  Under hypoxia  (oxygen  concentrations  ≤2 mg  l–1;  Limburg  et  al.,  2020), physiological and ecological processes are impaired and communities undergo  species  migration,  replacement  and  loss,  transforming community  composition  (very  high  confidence)  (Chu  and Tunnicliffe, 2015;  Gobler  and  Baumann,  2016;  Sampaio  et  al.,  2021).  Hypoxia can lead to expanding OMZs, which will favour specialised microbes and  hypoxia-tolerant  organisms  (medium  confidence)  (Breitburg et  al.,  2018;  Ramírez-Flandes  et  al.,  2019). As  respiration  consumes oxygen and produces CO2, lowered oxygen levels are often interlinked with acidification in coastal and tropical habitats (Rosa et al., 2013; Gobler and Baumann, 2016; Feely et al., 2018) and is an example of a compound hazard (Sections 3.2.4.1, 3.4.2.4).Increased density stratification and mixed-layer shallowing, caused by warming,  freshening  and  sea  ice  decline,  can  alter light climate and nutrient availability within the surface mixed layer (high confidence) (Section  3.2.2.3).  As  light  and  nutrient  levels  drive  photosynthesis, changes  in  these  drivers  directly  affect  primary  producers,  often  in different directions (Matsumoto et al., 2014; Deppeler and Davidson, 2017).  Decreased  upward  nutrient  supply  is  expected  to  decrease primary  production  in  the  low-latitude  ocean  (medium  confidence) (Section  3.4.4.2.1;  Moore  et  al.,  2018a;  Kwiatkowski  et  al.,  2019). Alternatively,  higher  mean  underwater  light  levels  resulting  from changes in sea ice and/or mixed layer shallowing can increase primary production in high-latitude offshore regions, provided nutrient levels remain sufficiently high (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.4.2.1; Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Vancoppenolle et al., 2013; Deppeler and Davidson, 2017; Tedesco et al., 2019; Ardyna and Arrigo, 2020; Lannuzel et al., 2020). In some parts of the open Southern Ocean, where iron limitation largely controls primary productivity (Tagliabue et al., 2017), changes in  wind  fields  will  deepen  the  summer  mixed-layer  depth  (Panassa et al., 2018), entrain more nutrients, and raise primary productivity in the future (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Hauck et al., 2015; Leung et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2018a; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).Climate-induced drivers fluctuate on time scales ranging from diurnal to  annual,  with  potential  consequences  for  organismal  responses (Figure  3.10),  but  these  fluctuations  are  commonly  not  incorporated experimentally.  Experiments  that  simulate  natural  fluctuations  in drivers,  especially  beyond  tidal  or  diel  cycles,  can  result  in  more detrimental  impacts  than  those  based  on  quasi-constant  conditions (Eriander  et  al.,  2015;  Sunday  et  al.,  2019),  but  can  also  ameliorate effects (Comeau et al., 2014; Laubenstein et al., 2020; Cabrerizo et al., 2021),  confirming  that  the  influence  of  environmental  variability requires evaluation (Dowd et al., 2015). Marine heatwaves exacerbate the  impacts  of  rising  mean  temperatures,  with  major  ecological consequences (very high confidence) (Frölicher et al., 2018; IPCC, 2018; Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2020; Laufkötter et al., 2020). Higher temperature variability  decreased  phytoplankton  growth  and  calcification  in Emiliania  huxleyi  relative  to  a  stable  warming  regime  (Wang  et  al., 2019b).  Diel  fluctuations  (i.e.,  over  24 h)  in  carbonate  chemistry superimposed  on  current  and  future  pCO2  levels  influenced  diatom species  differently,  depending  on  their  habitat  (Li  et  al.,  2016).  CO2 fluctuations overlaid on changing mean values also altered phenotypic evolutionary outcomes of picoeukaryotic algae (Schaum et al., 2016). In  the  bivalve  Mytilus  edulis,  fluctuating  pH  regimes  exerted  higher metabolic  costs  (Mangan  et  al.,  2017),  while  salinity  fluctuations might be more influential than pH fluctuations in other bivalves (Velez et al., 2016). The amplitude of diel and seasonal pH and CO2 changes are projected to increase in the future due to lowered CO2 seawater buffering capacity (very high confidence) (Section 3.2.3.1; Burger et al., 2020), which can impose additional stress on organisms.3.3.3 Responses to Multiple DriversEach organism encounters a unique combination of local and climate-induced  drivers,  which  vary  in  space  and  time.  The  contribution  of these drivers to an organism’s overall biological response, and thereby also  potential  risks  for  the  organism,  depends  on  the  intensity  and 3401Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesThe state of knowledge regarding ecological responses to environmental drivers in experimental settings(a)3(b)POLICYECOSYSTEM SERVICESBox3.1Ecosystem3.3.53.3.5CommunityECAPS3.3.43.3.2SpeciesSingleDRIVERDouble3.3.43.3.3AcclimatedMultipleAdaptedTIMECumulative effects Mechanistic understanding and projectionsInfluence of populations,communities, foodwebsInfluence of fluctuations,extremes, adaptation, etc.Multiple drivers with mechanisticunderstanding and projectionsMultiple drivers with demarcatedphysiological roles of each driverMultiple drivers with outcomes, assessment of interactionsMultiple drivers with outcomes (cum. effect, sign, magnitude)Single driver with outcome(s), underlying mechanism(s) and projectionsFigure 3.8 |  The state of knowledge regarding ecological responses to environmental drivers in experimental settings.(a)  Schematic indicates where themes are discussed within Section 3.3, and how they jointly inform policy.

At present, the upper grey layer has been achieved, in full, for two drivers (e.g., temperature and nutrient concentrations), with validation of dual controls on phytoplankton growth rate (Thomas et al., 2017). Hatched layers denote major advances since WGII AR5 Chapter 6 (Pörtner et al., 2014). The green layer indicates the level of understanding potentially needed to project the response of marine life subjected to multiple drivers.

The driver range that keeps physiological rates above a certain threshold represents the organism’s range of phenotypic plasticity, while below that threshold, the critical temperature (Tcrit), physiological performance is so low as to constitute stressful conditions. (b)  The response curve for one driver can depend on other drivers, here exemplified for temperature and pH in the central panel. This interaction causes rates as well as optima to change with pH (left) and temperature (right), indicated by the coloured lines. (c)  Impacts of multiple drivers on processes can be additive (blue), synergistic (red) or antagonistic (green), that is, the cumulative effects of two (or more) drivers are equal to, larger than or smaller than the sum of their individual effects, respectively. Potential experimental outcomes  affected  by  additive,  synergistic  and  antagonistic  interactions  are  shown  for  scenarios  where  drivers  increase  rates  (left),  decrease  rates  (centre)  or  cause  opposite responses (right), showing how experimental outcomes can mask these mechanistic interactions. (For a quantitative analysis of effects of driver pairs on animals, see Figure 3.SM.2.) (Adapted from Crain et al., 2008 and Piggott et al., 2015).403         3Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesduration of its exposure to these drivers and associated sensitivities. Both geographic location (e.g., polar, tropical) and marine habitat (e.g., benthic, pelagic) strongly affect the combination of climate and non-climate drivers to which organisms are exposed. Non-climate drivers (Section 3.1) can dominate outcomes or amplify vulnerability to climate-induced  drivers,  with  mostly  detrimental  effects  such  as  extirpation (very high confidence) (Section 3.4; Boyd et al., 2018; Gissi et al., 2021), and unique feedbacks may exist between climate change and drivers like  habitat  loss  or  invasive  species  that  further  confound  climate-change effects (Ortiz et al., 2018; Wolff et al., 2018; Gissi et al., 2021). Individual responses are further influenced by an organism’s behaviour, trophic level and life-history strategy (Figure 3.10; Przeslawski et al., 2015; Boyd et al., 2018). Evidence is increasing that some life-history stages are more sensitive to specific drivers than others (Dahlke et al., 2020b). To identify the most influential drivers for an organism requires targeting key traits (e.g., calcification, reproduction). The trophic level of the organism must also be considered, because autotrophs directly depend  on  light  and  nutrients  while  invertebrates  are  often  more sensitive to changes in oxygen or altered prey, but temperature plays a key role for both groups (Figure 3.10b).Co-occurring  environmental  drivers  often  cause  complex  organismal responses  (high  confidence)  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2014).  Individual  drivers can have detrimental, neutral or beneficial effects, depending on the relationship between driver and physiological process (Section 3.3.2; Figure 3.9a). Multiple drivers can have interactive effects, where the response to one driver alters the sensitivity to another, and outcomes cannot  be  deduced  from  individual  drivers’  effects  (Figure  3.9b). Impacts of multiple drivers can be additive, synergistic or antagonistic (Figure 3.9c; Crain et al., 2008; Piggott et al., 2015; Boyd et al., 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019a). Well-controlled laboratory studies on multiple-driver  effects  have  revealed  insights  into  the  mode  of  action  of individual drivers and their interdependence (Kroeker et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2019; Reddin et al., 2020; Seifert et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021b; Sampaio  et  al.,  2021).  Understanding  the  outcomes  of  interactive drivers  is  important  for  robustly  assessing  risks  to  organisms  under different climate-change scenarios.3.3.3.1 Effects of Multiple Drivers on Primary ProducersWarming  and  rising  CO2  concentrations  enhance  growth  and/or photosynthetic rates in many species of cyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, coccolithophores,  dinoflagellates  and  diatoms  (high  confidence) (Fu  et  al.,  2007;  Sett  et  al.,  2014;  Hoppe  et  al.,  2018a;  Wolf  et  al., 2018;  Brandenburg  et  al.,  2019),  and  the  optimum  pCO2  for  growth and/or  primary  production  shifts  upward  under  warming  (medium confidence) (Sett et al., 2014; Hoppe et al., 2018a). Warming and ocean acidification appear to jointly favour the proliferation and toxicity of harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (limited evidence, high agreement) (Section  3.5.5.3;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a;  Brandenburg  et  al.,  2019; Griffith  et  al.,  2019a; Wells  et  al.,  2020),  but  a  2021  analysis  found no uniform global trend in HABs or their distribution over 1985–2018 once  field  data  were  adjusted  for  regional  variations  in  monitoring effort (Hallegraeff et al., 2021). The predominantly detrimental impacts of  ocean  acidification  on  coccolithophores  can  partly  be  offset  by warming (Seifert et al., 2020) but also be exacerbated, depending on the magnitudes of drivers (D’Amario et al., 2020). For non-calcifying macroalgae, responses are highly species specific and often indicate synergistic  interactions  between  warming  and  acidification  (Kram et  al.,  2016;  Falkenberg  et  al.,  2018).  Ocean  acidification  poses  a large  risk  for  coralline  algae  that  is  further  amplified  by  warming (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.2.2; Cornwall et al., 2019). However, temperatures up to 5°C above ambient do not decrease calcification (Cornwall  et  al.,  2019),  and  there  is  limited  evidence  that  some species  have  the  physiological  capacity  to  resist  acidification  via  pH upregulation  at  the  calcification  site  (Cornwall  et  al.,  2017a).  For seagrass,  warming  beyond  a  species’  thermal  tolerance  will  limit growth  and  impact  germination,  but  ocean  acidification  appears  to increase thermal tolerance of some eelgrass species by increasing the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio (medium confidence) (Egea et al., 2018; Scalpone et al., 2020; Zimmerman, 2021).Thermal sensitivity of pelagic primary producers changes with nutrient supply (high confidence) (Thomas et al., 2017; Marañón et al., 2018; Fernández et al., 2020). Phosphorus limitation lowers the temperature optimum for growth of phytoplankton, making these organisms more prone to heat stress (Thomas et al., 2017; Bestion et al., 2018). This trend may hold for open-ocean phytoplankton, which are often iron-limited (medium confidence) (Boyd, 2019). Such temperature-nutrient interactions  might  be  especially  relevant  during  summer  MHWs (Section  3.2.2.1;  Cross-Chapter  Box  EXTREMES  in  Chapter  2;  IPCC, 2018;  Holbrook  et  al.,  2019;  DeCarlo  et  al.,  2020;  Hayashida  et  al., 2020), when primary producers are often nutrient-limited and near their thermal  limits.  Increasingly  frequent  and  intense  MHWs  along  with projected decreases in nutrient availability (Section 3.2.3.3) may push some  primary  producers  beyond  tolerance  thresholds. Temperature–nutrient  interactions  can  also  alter  the  photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio in phytoplankton (Marañón et al., 2018). Overall, rising metabolic rates due to warming will be restricted to primary producers in high-nutrient regions (medium confidence) (Thomas et al., 2017; Marañón et al., 2018). For zooxanthellae-containing corals, nutrient supply from upwelling or from runoff can increase coral susceptibility to bleaching during warm-season MHWs (DeCarlo et al., 2020; Wooldridge, 2020).The  effects  of  ocean  acidification  on  growth,  metabolic  rates  or elemental  composition  of  primary  producers  changes  with  nutrient availability  and  light  conditions  (high  confidence)  (Gao  et  al.,  2019; Seifert  et  al.,  2020).  While  interactions  with  nutrients  are  often additive in phytoplankton, diatoms revealed predominantly synergistic interactions (Seifert et al., 2020). Growth or photosynthesis of some diatom  and  HAB  species,  for  instance,  are  stimulated  by  ocean acidification only if nutrients are replete (Hoppe et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2015b; Eberlein et al., 2016; Griffith et al., 2019a). Interactions with light are more complex because relative effects of ocean acidification are  larger  under  limiting  irradiances,  while  saturating  light  levels decrease  beneficial  or  detrimental  effects  on  these  processes  (Kranz et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2011; Rokitta and Rost, 2012; Heiden et al., 2016).  For  the  coccolithophore  Emiliania  huxleyi,  for  example,  the impacts  of  ocean  acidification  are  less  detrimental  under  high  light availability,  which  could  partly  explain  why  this  species  is  moving poleward (Winter et al., 2014; Kondrik et al., 2017; Neukermans et al., 2018),  although  acidification  is  more  pronounced  in  polar  waters (Section 3.2.3.1; Cross-Chapter Paper 6). Under excess light, however, the detrimental impacts of ocean acidification are amplified for many 404Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Effect of environmental drivers varies depending on several factors(a)(b)pH8.78.68.58.48.38.28.18.07.97.80Adult(Benthic)Larva(Pelagic)Juvenile(Benthic)Juvenile(Benthic)Time (month)123PhytoplanktonSunlightCO2CO2CO2CO2CO2NutrientsTrace elementsPreyPreyO2O2pHOxygenPreyWater column(epipelagic) Water column(mesopelagic) Sea floor(benthic) TemperatureFigure 3.10 |  The effect of environmental drivers differs depending upon organisms’ life history, and trophic strategy or habitat. (a)  pH variability differs for benthic invertebrates, such as sea urchins (in blue), and their pelagic larvae (in green); pH fluctuations over the annual cycle can be much larger in the water column (due to primary production) relative to the seafloor. Variability associated with behaviour and life stage strongly defines organisms’ niches and sensitivities to present and future conditions.(b)  Examples of organisms that are influenced by different suites of drivers that are set jointly by their habitat (e.g., benthic versus epipelagic settings) and trophic strategy (e.g., nutrients for phytoplankton, prey characteristics for grazers).405Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesspecies  (high  confidence)  (Gao  et  al.,  2012;  Li  and  Campbell,  2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Kottmeier et al., 2016; Gafar et al., 2019). Lowered photo-physiological capacity to cope with high-light stress and avoid photodamage (Gao et al., 2012; Li and Campbell, 2013; Hoppe et al., 2015;  Kvernvik  et  al.,  2020)  is  also  consistent  with  observations that  dynamic  light  regimes  can  become  more  stressful  under  ocean acidification (Jin et al., 2013; Hoppe et al., 2015). Given the expected mixed-layer shallowing in some regions (Section 3.2.2.3), the exposure to overall higher mean irradiances could shift the effects of acidification from beneficial to detrimental for some primary producers, depending on  species  and  organismal  traits  (medium  confidence)  (Gao  et  al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2020).Studies investigating two drivers provide most of the information on the wide range of interactive effects of drivers on phytoplankton (Gao et al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2020), although climate change alters several oceanic drivers concurrently (Section 3.2). The few experimental studies that have addressed three or more drivers (Xu et al., 2014; Boyd et al., 2015b; Brennan and Collins, 2015; Brennan et al., 2017; Hoppe et al., 2018b;  Moreno-Marín  et  al.,  2018)  indicate  that  one  or  two  drivers generally  dominate  the  cumulative  outcome,  with  others  playing  a subordinate role (medium confidence). In these studies, temperature had a disproportionately large influence, while other drivers differed in importance, depending on the type of primary producer, ecosystem characteristics and selected driver values.33.3.3.2 Effects of Multiple Drivers on AnimalsWhen  changing  CO2  concentrations  affect  marine  ectotherms,  they typically combine additively or synergistically with warming (medium confidence)  (e.g.,  Lefevre,  2016;  Reddin  et  al.,  2020;  Sampaio  et  al., 2021), and their cumulative effects can lead to detrimental, neutral or beneficial effects (high confidence) (Figure 3.9a; Bennett et al., 2017; Büscher et al., 2017; Dahlke et al., 2017; Foo and Byrne, 2017; Johnson et al., 2017b; Cominassi et al., 2019). Higher ocean CO2 influences the thermal tolerance of species adapted to extreme but stable habitats in  tropical  and  polar  regions,  more  than  that  of  thermally  tolerant generalists (high confidence) (Byrne et al., 2013; Schiffer et al., 2014; Flynn et al., 2015; Kunz et al., 2016; Pörtner et al., 2017; Kunz et al., 2018;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a;  but  see  Ern  et  al.,  2017),  especially  in early  life  stages  (Dahlke  et  al.,  2020a).  In  thermal  generalists  from temperate  and  subtropical  species,  warming  and  ocean  acidification generally have detrimental effects on growth and survival (e.g., Gao et  al.,  2020),  but  warming  can  also  alleviate  the  detrimental  effects of  ocean  acidification  by  increasing  metabolic  rate  and/or  growth (Garzke  et  al.,  2020),  provided  that  other  conditions  (e.g.,  thermal niche, food availability) are beneficial. For example, larval growth and survival  of Australasian  snapper  (Pagrus  auratus)  appear  to  benefit from combined acidification and warming (but see Watson et al., 2018; McMahon et al., 2020), introducing major uncertainties to population modelling (Section 3.3.4; Parsons et al., 2020).As  with  ocean  acidification,  reduced  oxygen  availability  further alters the influence of warming on metabolic rates (high confidence). Acidification and hypoxia can contribute to a decrease or shift in thermal tolerance, while the magnitude of this effect depends on the duration of exposure (Tripp-Valdez et al., 2017; Cattano et al., 2018; Calderón-406Liévanos et al., 2019; Schwieterman et al., 2019). Warming and hypoxia are  mostly  positively  correlated  and  tolerances  to  both  phenomena are  often  linked  after  long-term  acclimation  (e.g.,  Bouyoucos  et  al., 2020).  Acute  short-term  heat  shocks  can  impair  hypoxia  tolerance, for  instance,  in  intertidal  fish  (McArley  et  al.,  2020). This  is  relevant for  shallow  waters,  specifically  for  MHWs  (Section  3.2.2.1;  Hobday et al., 2016a; IPCC, 2018; Collins et al., 2019a). Ocean acidification can increase hypoxia tolerance in some cases, possibly by downregulating activity  (Faleiro  et  al.,  2015)  and/or  changing  blood  oxygenation (Montgomery et al., 2019). Other studies, however, reported additive negative  effects  of  acidification  and  warming  on  hypoxia  tolerance (Schwieterman et al., 2019; Götze et al., 2020), in line with the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis presented in  AR5  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2014):  Warming  causes  increased  metabolic rates and oxygen demand in ectotherms, which at some point exceed supply  capacities  (which  also  depend  on  environmental  oxygen availability) and reduce aerobic scope. In consequence, expansion of OMZs  and  other  regions  where  warming,  hypoxia  and  acidification combine  will  further  reduce  habitat  for  many  fish  and  invertebrates (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.3.2, 3.4.3.3).Food  availability  modulates,  and  may  be  more  influential  than, other  driver  responses  by  affecting  the  energetic  and  nutritional status  of  animals  (Cole  et  al.,  2016;  Stiasny  et  al.,  2019;  Cominassi et  al.,  2020).  Laboratory  studies  conducted  under  an  excess  of  food risk  underestimating  the  ecological  effects  of  climate-induced drivers,  because  increased  feeding  rates  may  help  mitigate  adverse effects  (Nowicki  et  al.,  2012;  Towle  et  al.,  2015;  Cominassi  et  al., 2020).  Lowered  food  availability  from  reduced  open-ocean  primary production (Sections 3.2.3.3, 3.4.4.2.1) will act as an additional driver, amplifying the detrimental effects of other drivers. However, warming and higher CO2 availability may increase primary productivity in some coastal areas (Section 3.4.4.1), ameliorating the adverse direct effects on animals (e.g., Sswat et al., 2018). Due to the few studies addressing food availability under multiple-driver scenarios (Thomsen et al., 2013; Pistevos et al., 2015; Towle et al., 2015; Ramajo et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018a; Cominassi et al., 2020), there is medium confidence in its modulating effect on climate-induced driver responses.Animal  behaviour  can  be  affected  by  ocean  acidification,  warming and  hypoxia.  While  warming  and  hypoxia  mostly  induce  avoidance behaviour,  potentially  leading  to  migration  and  habitat  compression (Section  3.4;  McCormick  and  Levin,  2017;  Limburg  et  al.,  2020),  the effects of acidification appear more complex. Some studies reported that acidification dominates behavioural effects (Schmidt et al., 2017), although  outcomes  vary  with  experimental  design  and  duration of  exposure  (low  confidence,  low  agreement)  (Maximino  and  de Brito,  2010;  Munday  et  al.,  2016;  Laubenstein  et  al.,  2018;  Munday et  al.,  2019;  Sundin  et  al.,  2019;  Clark  et  al.,  2020;  Munday  et  al., 2020;  Williamson  et  al.,  2021).  Behaviour  represents  an  integrated phenomenon  that  can  be  influenced  both  directly  and  indirectly by  multiple  drivers.  For  instance,  increased  pCO2  can  directly  act on  neuronal  signalling  pathways  (e.g.,  Gamma-aminobutyric  acid hypothesis;  Nilsson  et  al.,  2012; Thomas  et  al.,  2020)  and  influence learning (Chivers et al., 2014), vision (Chung et al., 2014), and choice and escape behaviour (Watson et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017b). There is further evidence that observed alterations in fish olfactory behaviour Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3under ocean acidification may result from physiological and molecular changes  of  the  olfactory  epithelium,  influencing  olfactory  receptors (Roggatz et al., 2016; Porteus et al., 2018; Velez et al., 2019; Mazurais et al., 2020). Temperature mainly drives metabolic processes and thus energetic  requirements,  which  can  indirectly  influence  behaviour, including  increased  risk-taking  during  feeding  (Marangon  et  al., 2020).  Ocean  warming  also  accelerates  the  biochemical  reactions and metabolic processes that are primarily influenced by acidification. It  is  therefore  difficult  to  generalise  to  what  extent  co-occurring ocean warming ameliorates or exacerbates effects of acidification on behaviour (Laubenstein et al., 2019); outcomes depend upon species and life stage (Faleiro et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2016; Tills et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018b; Jarrold et al., 2020), interactions between species (e.g.,  Paula  et  al.,  2019)  along  with  confounding  factors  including food  availability  and  salinity  (medium  confidence)  (Ferrari  et  al., 2015; Pistevos et al., 2015; Pimentel et al., 2016; Pistevos et al., 2017; Horwitz et al., 2020).While hypoxia can dominate multiple-driver responses locally (Sampaio et  al.,  2021),  warming  is  the  fundamental  physiological  driver  for most  marine  ectotherms,  globally,  as  it  directly  affects  their  entire biochemistry and energy metabolism. Other influential drivers include ocean acidification, salinity (high confidence) (Lefevre, 2016; Whiteley et al., 2018; Reddin et al., 2020) or food availability/quality (medium confidence)  (Nagelkerken  and  Munday,  2016;  Gao  et  al.,  2020). Fluctuating  and  decreasing  salinity  may  aggravate  the  detrimental effects of warming and elevated CO2, because dilution with freshwater lowers acid–base buffering capacity, resulting in lower pH and calcium carbonate saturation state (Dickinson et al., 2012; Shrivastava et al., 2019; Melzner et al., 2020).3.3.4 Acclimation and Evolutionary AdaptationClimate  change  is  and  will  continue  to  be  a  major  driver  of  natural selection,  causing  important  changes  in  fitness-related  (e.g.,  growth, reproduction, survival) and functional (e.g., body/cell size, morphology, physiology)  traits,  and  in  the  genetic  diversity  of  natural  populations (medium  confidence)  (Pauls  et  al.,  2013;  Merilä  and  Hendry,  2014). Climate-change impacts will continue to be exacerbated by interactions with non-climate drivers such as habitat fragmentation or loss, pollution or  resource  overexploitation,  which  limit  the  adaptive  potential  of populations  to  future  conditions  (Trathan  et  al.,  2015;  Gaitán-Espitia and  Hobday,  2021).  However  the  ultimate  responses  to  complex change are conditioned by the rate and magnitude of environmental change,  organisms’  capacity  for  acclimation,  the  degree  of  local adaptation  of  natural  populations  and  populations’  potential  for adaptive evolution (Figure 3.11; Pespeni et al., 2013; Calosi et al., 2017; Vargas  et  al.,  2017). These  controlling  factors  are  mainly  determined by local environmental conditions encountered by populations across their geographic distribution (Boyd et al., 2016). In highly fluctuating environments (e.g., upwelling regions, coastal zones), multiple drivers can change and interact across temporal and spatial scales, generating geographic  mosaics  of  tolerances  and  sensitivities  to  environmental and climate change in marine organisms (medium confidence) (Pespeni et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2016; Vargas et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a). A further challenge for marine life lies in its ability to cope with extreme events  such  as  MHWs  (Cross-Chapter  Box  EXTREMES  in  Chapter  2). The interplay between the abruptness, intensity, duration, magnitude and reoccurrence of extreme events may alter or prevent evolutionary responses  (e.g.,  adaptation)  to  climate  change  and  the  potential  for acclimation to extreme conditions such as MHWs (Cheung and Frölicher, 2020; Coleman et al., 2020a; Gurgel et al., 2020; Gruber et al., 2021).Some  studies  have  documented  higher  phenotypic  plasticity  and tolerance to ocean warming and acidification in marine invertebrates (Dam,  2013;  Kelly  et  al.,  2013;  Pespeni  et  al.,  2013;  Gaitán-Espitia et al., 2017a; Vargas et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a), seaweeds (Noisette et  al.,  2013;  Padilla-Gamiño  et  al.,  2016;  Machado  Monteiro  et  al., 2019)  and  fish  (medium  confidence)  (Sandoval-Castillo  et  al.,  2020; Enbody  et  al.,  2021)  living  in  coastal  zones  characterised  by  strong temporal  fluctuations  in  temperature,  pH,  pCO2,  light  and  nutrients. For  these  populations,  strong  directional  selection  with  intense  and highly  fluctuating  conditions  may  have  favoured  local  adaptation and increased tolerance to environmental stress (low confidence, low evidence) (Hong and Shurin, 2015; Gaitán-Espitia et al., 2017b; Li et al., 2018a).Other mechanisms acting within and across generations can influence selection  and inter-population  tolerances  to  environmental  and climate-induced  drivers.  For  instance,  transgenerational  effects  and/or developmental acclimation, both ‘carry-over effects’ (where the early-life  environment  affects  the  expression  of  traits  in  later  life  stages  or generations),  can  influence  within-  and  cross-generational  changes in  the  tolerances  of  marine  organisms  (medium  confidence)  to  ocean warming (Balogh and Byrne, 2020) and acidification (Parker et al., 2012). Over  longer  time  scales,  increasing  tolerance  to  these  drivers  may  be mediated by mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (Murray et al., 2014), leading to locally adapted genotypes as seen in bivalves (Thomsen et al., 2017), annelids (Rodríguez-Romero et al., 2016; Thibault et al., 2020), corals (Putnam et al., 2020) and coralline algae (Cornwall et  al.,  2020).  However,  transgenerational  plasticity  is  species  specific (Byrne et al., 2020; Thibault et al., 2020) and, depending on the rate and magnitude  of  environmental  change,  it  may  either  be  insufficient  for evolutionary rescue (Morgan et al., 2020) or could induce maladaptive responses (i.e., reduced fitness) in marine organisms exposed to multiple drivers  (medium  confidence,  low  evidence)  (Figure  3.11;  Griffith  and Gobler, 2017; Parker et al., 2017; Byrne et al., 2020).Acclimation  to  environmental  pressures  and  climate  change  via phenotypic  plasticity  (Section  3.3.3;  Collins  et  al.,  2020)  enables species  to  undergo  niche  shifts  such  that  their  present-day  climatic niche  is  altered  to  incorporate  new  or  shifted  conditions  (Fox  et  al., 2019).  Although  plasticity  provides  an  adaptive  mechanism,  it  is unlikely  to  provide  a  long-term  solution  for  species  undergoing sustained  directional  environmental  change  (e.g.,  global  warming) (medium  confidence)  (Fox  et  al.,  2019;  Gaitán-Espitia  and  Hobday, 2021).  Beyond  the  limits  for  plastic  responses  (Figure  3.9;  DeWitt et al., 1998; Valladares et al., 2007), genetic adjustments are required to  persist  in  a  changing  world  (Figure  3.11;  Fox  et  al.,  2019).  The ability of species and populations to undergo these adjustments (i.e., adaptive  evolution)  depends  on  extrinsic  factors  including  the  rate and  magnitude  of  environmental  change  (important  determinants of  the  strength  and  form  of  selection;  Hoffmann  and  Sgrò,  2011; 3407Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesMunday et al., 2013), along with intrinsic factors such as generation times  and  standing  genetic  variation  (Mitchell-Olds  et  al.,  2007; Lohbeck et al., 2012). Accurately assessing the degree of acclimation and/or  adaptation  across  space  and  time  is  difficult  and  constrains studying  adaptive  evolution  in  natural  populations. There  is  a  major gap  in  climate-change  biology  related  to  the  study  of  evolutionary responses in complex and long-lived multicellular organisms. Insights on organismal acclimation, adaptation and evolution rely on studies of small, short-lived marine organisms, such as phytoplankton, which divide rapidly and contain high genetic variation in large populations. (Schaum et al., 2016; Cavicchioli et al., 2019; Collins et al., 2020).Experimental  evolution  suggests  that  microbial  populations  can rapidly  adapt  (i.e.,  over  1–2  years)  to  environmental  changes mimicking projected effects of climate change (medium confidence). Phytoplankton adaptive mechanisms include intraspecific strain sorting and genetic changes (Bach et al., 2018; Hoppe et al., 2018b; Wolf et al., 2019). The evolutionary responses of microbes are conditioned by the number  and  characteristics  of  interacting  drivers  (low  confidence) (Brennan et al., 2017). For example, in a high-salinity adapted strain of the phytoplankton Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the selection intensity and the adaptation rate increased with the number of environmental drivers,  accelerating  the  adaptive  evolutionary  response  (Brennan et al., 2017). For this and other phytoplankton species, a few dominant drivers  explain  most  of  the  phenotypic  and  evolutionary  changes observed  (Boyd  et  al.,  2015a;  Brennan  and  Collins,  2015;  Brennan et al., 2017).Adaptation  can  be  impeded,  delayed  or  constrained  in  eukaryotic microbial populations as a result of reduced genetic diversity and/or the presence of functional and evolutionary trade-offs (Aranguren-Gassis et al., 2019; Lindberg and Collins, 2020; Walworth et al., 2020).

Simplified conceptual framework shows two main eco-evolutionary trajectories for natural populations over time (vertical axis from top to bottom). If environmental stress is low, rapid responses (within a generation) through plastic phenotypic adjustments and selection (across generations) sustain fitness, enhancing maintenance of viable populations across generations. In contrast, if environmental stress is high, ongoing phenotypic plasticity and acclimation may be insufficient to buffer the negative effects, exacerbating the loss of fitness (change of colour to orange/yellow/red). Ultimately, very high stress conditions accelerate population decline, enhancing the risk of species extinction.408Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3inhibited underlies thermal  adaptation  under  nitrogen-limited conditions  (low  confidence)  (Aranguren-Gassis  et  al.,  2019).  When selection  is  strong  due  to  unfavourable  environmental  conditions, microbial  populations  can  encounter  functional  and  evolutionary trade-offs  evidenced  by  reducing  growth  rates  while  increasing tolerance  and  metabolism  of  reactive  oxygen  species  (Lindberg  and Collins,  2020).  Other  trade-offs  can  be  observed  in  offspring  quality and  number  (Lindberg  and  Collins,  2020). These  findings  contribute towards a mechanistic framework describing the range of evolutionary strategies in response to multiple drivers (Collins et al., 2020), but other hazards, such as extreme events (e.g., MHWs), still need to be included because their characteristics may alter the potential for adaptation of species and populations to climate change (Gruber et al., 2021).3.3.5 Ecological Response to Multiple DriversAssessing  ecological  responses  to  multiple  climate-induced  drivers requires  a  combination  of  approaches,  including  laboratory-  and field-based  experiments,  field  observations  (e.g.,  natural  gradients, climate  analogues),  study  of  paleo-analogues  and  the  development of  mechanistic  and  empirical  models  (Clapham,  2019;  Gissi  et  al., 2021). Experimental studies of food-web responses are often limited to  an  individual  driver,  although  recent  manipulations  have  used  a matrix of &gt;1000-l mesocosms to explore ecological responses to both warming  and  acidification  (see  Box  3.1;  Nagelkerken  et  al.,  2020). Hence,  complementary  approaches  are  needed  to  indirectly  explore the  mechanisms  underlying  ecosystem  responses  to  global  climate change (Parmesan et al., 2013). Observations from time series longer than  modes  of  natural  variability  (i.e.,  decades)  are  essential  for revealing and attributing ecological responses to climate change (e.g., Section 3.4; Barton et al., 2015b; Brun et al., 2019). Also, paleorecords provide  insights  into  the  influence  of  multiple  drivers  on  marine biota  (Cross-Chapter  Box  PALEO  in  Chapter  1;  Reddin  et  al.,  2020). Specifically, associations between vulnerabilities and traits of marine ectotherms  in  laboratory  experiments  correspond  with  organismal responses  to  ancient  hyperthermal  events  (medium  confidence) (Reddin  et  al.,  2020). This  corroboration  suggests  that  responses  to multiple drivers inferred from the fossil record can help provide insights into the future status of functional groups, and hence food webs, under rapid climate change.Multi-species  and  integrated  end-to-end  ecosystem  models  are powerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting cumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers (Section 3.1; Kaplan and Marshall, 2016; Koenigstein et al., 2016; Peck and  Pinnegar,  2018; Tittensor  et  al.,  2018;  Gissi  et  al.,  2021). These models  can  integrate  some  aspects  of  the  knowledge  accrued  from manipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help test the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, and identify synergistic or antagonistic responses (Koenigstein et al., 2016; Payne et al., 2016; Skogen et al., 2018; Tittensor et al., 2018). As  these  models  are  associated  with  wide-ranging  uncertainties (SM3.2.2;  Payne  et  al.,  2016;  Trolle  et  al.,  2019;  Heneghan  et  al., 2021), they cannot be expected to accurately project the trajectories of complex marine ecosystems under climate change; hence, they are most useful for assessing overall trends and in particular for providing a  plausible  envelope  of  trajectories  across  a  range  of  assumptions (Fulton et al., 2018; Peck et al., 2018; Tittensor et al., 2018). On a global scale,  ecosystem  models  project  a  −5.7  ±  4.1%  (very  likely  range) to  −15.5  ±  8.5%  decline  in  marine  animal  biomass  with  warming under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, by 2080–2099 relative to 1995–2014,  albeit  with  significant  regional  variation  in  both  trends and  uncertainties  (medium  confidence)  (Section  3.4.3.4;  Tittensor et  al.,  2021).  Biological  interactions  may  exacerbate  or  buffer  the projected  impacts.  For  instance,  trophic  amplification  (strengthening of responses to climate-induced drivers at higher trophic levels) may result  from  combined  direct  and  indirect  food-web-mediated  effects (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.3.4; Lotze et al., 2019). Alternatively, compensatory  species  interactions  can  dampen  strong  impacts  on species  from  ocean  acidification,  resulting  in  weaker  responses  at functional-group  or  community  level  than  at  species  level  (medium confidence)  (Marshall  et  al.,  2017;  Hoppe  et  al.,  2018b;  Olsen  et  al., 2018; Gissi et al., 2021). Globally, the projected reduction of biomass due  to  climate-induced  drivers  is  relatively  unaffected  by  fishing pressure, indicating additive responses of fisheries and climate change (low confidence) (Lotze et al., 2019). Regionally, projected interactions of  climate-induced  drivers,  fisheries  and  other  regional  non-climate drivers can be both synergistic and antagonistic, varying across regions, functional groups and species, and can cause nonlinear dynamics with counterintuitive outcomes, underlining the importance of adaptations and associated trade-offs (high confidence) (Sections 3.5.3, 3.6.3.1.2, 4.5, 4.6; Weijerman et al., 2015; Fulton et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019; Trolle et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020; Pethybridge et al., 2020; Gissi et al., 2021).Given the limitations of individual ecological models discussed above, model intercomparisons, such as the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP; Tittensor et al., 2018) show promise in increasing the robustness of projected ecological outcomes (Tittensor  et  al.,  2018).  Model  ensembles  include  a  greater  number of  relevant  processes  and  functional  groups  than  any  single  model and  thus  capture  a  wider  range  of  plausible  responses. Among  the global Fish-MIP models, there is high (temperate and tropical areas) to medium agreement (coastal and polar regions) on the direction of change, but medium (temperate and tropical regions) to low agreement (coastal and polar regions) on magnitude of change (Lotze et al., 2019; Heneghan et al., 2021). Although model outputs are validated relative to  observations  to  assess  model  skills  (Payne  et  al.,  2016; Tittensor et  al.,  2018),  the  Fish-MIP  models  under-represent  some  sources  of uncertainty, as they often do not include parameter uncertainties and do  not  usually  include  impacts  of  ocean  acidification,  oxygen  loss or  evolutionary  responses  because  there  remains  high  uncertainty regarding the influences of these processes across functional groups. Ensemble model investigations like Fish-MIP have also identified gaps in our mechanistic understanding of ecosystems and their responses to  anthropogenic  forcing,  leading  to  model  improvement  and  more rigorous  benchmarking.  These  investigations  could  inspire  future targeted observational and experimental research to test the validity of model assumptions (Payne et al., 2016; Lotze et al., 2019; Heneghan et  al.,  2021).  The  state  of  the  art  in  such  experimental  research  is presented in Box 3.1.3409Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services3.4 Observed and Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Systems3.4.1 IntroductionOcean  and  coastal  ecosystems  and  their  resident  species  are  under increasing  pressure  from  a  multitude  of  climate-induced  drivers  and non-climate  drivers  (Section  3.1;  Figure  3.12;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a). This  section  builds  from  the  assessment  of  biological  responses  to climate-impact  drivers  (Section  3.3)  to  examine  the  new  evidence about  climate-change  impacts  at  the  level  of  marine  ecosystems.  It focuses on detection and attribution of observed changes to marine ecosystems and the projected changes under different future climate scenarios. This assessment considers emerging evidence on the effects of  multiple  non-climate  drivers  and  physiological  acclimation  and/or evolutionary adaptation on these observations and projections.3The section focuses first on coastal ecosystems and seas (Section 3.4.2), in  physical  and  chemical which  have  high  spatial  variability characteristics, are affected by many non-climate drivers (Section 3.1; Figure 3.12) and support rich fisheries, high biodiversity and high levels of species endemism. The assessment begins with warm-water coral reefs (Section 3.4.2.1) because these highly threatened systems are at the vanguard of research on acclimation and evolutionary adaptation among coastal ecosystems. It follows with the other shallow, nearshore ecosystems dominated by habitat-forming species (e.g., rocky shores, kelp  systems)  and  then  nearshore  sedimentary  systems  (estuaries, deltas,  coastal  wetlands  and  sandy  beaches),  before  moving  on  to semi-enclosed seas, shelf seas, upwelling zones and polar seas.The  section  continues  on  to  oceanic  and  cross-cutting  changes (Section  3.4.3),  which  influence  large  areas  of  the  epipelagic  zone (&lt;200 m depth) while also affecting the mesopelagic (200–1000 m), the  perpetually  dark  bathypelagic  (depth  &gt;1000 m)  and  the  deep seafloor (benthic ecosystems at depths &gt;200 m) zones. Assessed in this section are species range shifts (Section 3.4.3.1), phenological shifts and trophic mismatches (Section 3.4.3.2), changes in communities and biodiversity (Section 3.4.3.3.2), time of emergence of climate-impact signals  in  ecological  systems  from  background  natural  variability (Section 3.4.3.3.4) and changes in biomass, primary productivity and carbon export (Sections 3.4.3.4–3.4.3.6).3.4.2 Coastal Ecosystems and Seas3.4.2.1  Warm-Water Coral ReefsWarm-water  coral  reef  ecosystems  house  one-quarter  of  the  marine biodiversity  and  provide  services  in  the  form  of  food,  income  and shoreline protection to coastal communities around the world. These ecosystems are threatened by climate-induced and non-climate drivers, especially  ocean  warming,  MHWs,  ocean  acidification,  SLR,  tropical cyclones,  fisheries/overharvesting, land-based  pollution,  disease spread  and  destructive  shoreline  practices  (Hoegh-Guldberg  et  al., 2018a; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Hughes et al., 2020). Warm-water coral reefs face near-term threats to their survival (Table 3.3), but research on observed and projected impacts is very advanced.Box 3.1 | Challenges for Multiple-Driver Research in Ecology and EvolutionThe majority of the examples in Section 3.3 are from studies mimicking projected conditions in the year 2100 that report the responses of an individual species or strain to multiple drivers. This powerful generic experimental approach has largely been restricted to single species because it is logistically complex to conduct experiments that straddle multiple trophic levels, and that also include more than two drivers (see Figure Box 3.1.1b); the need for multiple replicates, drivers and treatment levels greatly increase the work required (Parmesan et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2018). It is challenging to apply this experimental approach to communities or ecosystems (see Figure Box 3.1.1). To date, most research on community or ecosystem response to climate-induced drivers has been in large-volume (&gt;10,000 l) mesocosms (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014), or at natural analogues such as CO2 seeps, in which only one driver (ocean acidification) is altered (see (4) in Figure Box 3.1.1). Only very recently have two drivers been incorporated into climate-change manipulation studies examining responses of primary producers to secondary consumers (see (5) in Figure Box 3.1.1a; Nagelkerken et al., 2020). Therefore, ‘natural experiments’ from the geological past (Reddin et al., 2020) provide insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to complex change involving multiple drivers. Contemporary observations are occasionally long enough (&gt;50 years) to capture community responses to complex climate change. For example, Brun et al. (2019) reported a shift in zooplankton community structure in the North Atlantic (1960–2014), with major biogeochemical ramifications.Conducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult (see Figure Box 3.1.1b), with much research restricted to multi-year studies of the microevolution of fast-growing (more than one division per day) phytoplankton species responding to single drivers (Lohbeck et al., 2012; Schaum et al., 2016). In a few experimental evolution studies (see (7) in Figure Box 3.1.1a; Brennan et al., 2017), multiple drivers have been used, but none have used communities or ecosystems (see Figure Box 3.1.1b). Nevertheless, the fossil record provides limited evidence of adaptations to less rapid (relative to present day) climate change (Jackson et al., 2018). Despite the need to explore ecological or biogeochemical responses to projected future ocean conditions, logistical challenges require that assessments of climate-change impacts at scales larger than mesocosms use large-scale, long-term in situ observational studies (as documented in Section 3.4).410Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box 3.1 (continued)Knowledge gaps between current scientific understanding and that needed to inform policy(a)(b)EcosystemCommunitywonkottnaWSpeciesSingleDRIVERECAPS5Want  to know431Want to knowDoubleMultiple62POLICYEcosystemAdaptedultipleMsrerivd7AdaptedTIMEAcclimated3EcosystemCommunityECAPSSpecies12DRIVER NUMBER34+2000AcclimationAdaptation2020201520052010YEAR OF PUBLICATIONFigure Box 3.1.1 |  Knowledge gaps between current scientific understanding and that needed to inform policy.

The  mass coral bleaching, which occurred continuously across different parts of the  tropics  from  2014  to  2016,  is  considered  the  longest  and  most severe  global  coral  bleaching  event  on  record  (Section  10.4.3;  see Box 15.2; Eakin et al., 2019). The Great Barrier Reef underwent mass bleaching three times between 2016 and 2020 (see Box 11.2; Pratchett et al., 2021), validating past model projections that some warm-water coral reefs would encounter bleaching-level heat stress multiple times per decade by the 2020s (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Donner, 2009).Heat stress and mass bleaching events caused decreases in live coral cover (virtually certain) (Graham et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2018b), loss of sensitive species (extremely likely) (Donner and Carilli, 2019; Lange and Perry, 2019; Toth et al., 2019; Courtney et al., 2020), vulnerability to disease (extremely likely) (van Woesik and Randall, 2017; Hadaidi et al., 2018; Brodnicke et al., 2019; Howells et al., 2020) and declines in  coral  recruitment  in  the  tropics  (medium  confidence)  (Hughes et  al.,  2019;  Price  et  al.,  2019).  Recent  observations  also  suggest that excess nutrients can increase the susceptibility of corals to heat stress  (DeCarlo  et  al.,  2020).  Changes  in  coral  community  structure due to bleaching have caused declines in reef carbonate production (high  confidence)  (Perry  and  Morgan,  2017;  Lange  and  Perry,  2019; Perry  and Alvarez-Filip,  2019;  Courtney  et  al.,  2020;  van Woesik  and 3Cacciapaglia, 2021) and in reef structural complexity (high confidence, very likely) (Couch et al., 2017; Leggat et al., 2019; Magel et al., 2019), which increases water depth, reduces wave attenuation and increases coastal  flood  risk  (Yates  et  al.,  2017;  Beck  et  al.,  2018).  Corals  may also lose reproductive synchrony through climate change (Shlesinger and  Loya,  2019),  adding  to  their  vulnerability.  Bleaching  and  other drivers promote phase shifts to ecosystems dominated by macroalgae or other stress-tolerant species (very high confidence) (Graham et al., 2015; Stuart-Smith et al., 2018), leading to changes in reef-fish species assemblages  (high  confidence)  (Richardson  et  al.,  2018;  Robinson et al., 2019a; Stuart-Smith et al., 2021).Ocean  acidification  and  associated  declines  in  aragonite  saturation state  (Ωaragonite)  decrease  rates  of  calcification  by  corals  and  other calcifying reef organisms (very high confidence), reduce coral settlement (medium confidence) and increase bioerosion and dissolution of reef substrates  (high  confidence)  (Hoegh-Guldberg  et  al.,  2018a;  Bindoff et  al.,  2019a;  Kline  et  al.,  2019;  Pitts  et  al.,  2020).  Warming  can exacerbate  the  coral  response  to  ocean  acidification  (Kornder  et  al., 2018) and accelerate the decrease in coral skeletal density (Guo et al., 2020). In addition, reefs with lower coral cover and a higher proportion of slow-growing species, because of bleaching, are more sensitive to acidification  (net  dissolution  occurs  Ωaragonite  =  2.3  for  100%  coral cover,  and  Ωaragonite  &gt;3.5  for  30%  coral  cover;  Kline  et  al.,  2019). However,  experimental  evidence  suggests  that  coral  responses  to ocean acidification are species specific (medium confidence) (Fabricius et al., 2011; DeCarlo et al., 2018; Comeau et al., 2019).

The integrated effect of acidification, bleaching,  storms  and  other  non-climate  drivers  on  corals,  coralline algae  and  other  calcifiers  can  further  compromise  reef  integrity  and ecosystem services (Rivest et al., 2017; Cornwall et al., 2018; Perry and Alvarez-Filip, 2019).Since  SROCC,  there  have  been  advances  in  experimental,  field  and modelling  research  on  the  projected  response  of  coral  cover  and reef  growth  to  bleaching  and  ocean  acidification  (Cziesielski  et  al., 2019; Morikawa and Palumbi, 2019; Cornwall et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2021; Logan et al., 2021; McManus et al., 2021), and on the effect of possible human interventions like assisted evolution on coral resilience (Section 3.6.3.2.2; Condie et al., 2021; Hafezi et al., 2021; Kleypas et al., 2021). New model projections incorporating physiological acclimation, larval dispersal and evolutionary processes find limited ability to adapt this century at rates of warming at or exceeding that in RCP4.5 (high confidence,  very  likely)  (Bay  et  al.,  2017;  Kubicek  et  al.,  2019;  Matz et  al.,  2020;  McManus  et  al.,  2020;  Logan  et  al.,  2021;  McManus et al., 2021). For example, a global analysis (Logan et al., 2021) finds that  increased  thermal  tolerance  via  evolution  or  switching  to  more stress-tolerant algal symbionts enable most (73–81%) coral to survive through 2100 under RCP2.6, but coral-dominated communities with a historical mix of coral taxa still disappear (0–8% coral survival) under RCP6.0  in  simulations  with  adaptive  mechanisms  (Figure  3.13).  Due to the impacts of warming, and to a lesser extent ocean acidification, global  reef  carbonate  production  is  estimated  to  decline  71%  by 2050 in SSP1-2.6, and the rate of SLR is estimated to exceed that of reef growth for 97% of reefs assessed, without adaptation by corals and  their  symbionts  (WGI AR6 Table  9.9;  Cornwall  et  al.,  2021;  Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). The increased water depth due to coral loss and reef erosion, as well as reduced structural complexity, will limit wave attenuation  and  exacerbate  the  risk  of  flooding  from  SLR  on  reef-Table 3.3 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of coral reefsObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014)3Coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems (high confidence), and more than half of the world’s reefs are under medium or high risk of degradation.Mass coral bleaching and mortality, triggered by positive temperature anomalies (high confidence), is the most widespread and conspicuous impact of climate change. Ocean acidification reduces biodiversity and the calcification rate of corals (high confidence) while at the same time increasing the rate of dissolution of the reef framework (medium confidence).‘In summary, ocean warming is the primary cause of mass coral bleaching and mortality (very high confidence), which, together with ocean acidification, deteriorates the balance between coral reef construction and erosion (high confidence).’‘Coral bleaching and mortality will increase in frequency and magnitude over the next decades (very high confidence).’ Analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 ensemble projects the loss of coral reefs from most sites globally by 2050 under mid to high rates of warming (very likely).‘Under the A1B CO2 emission scenario, 99% of the reef locations will experience at least one severe bleaching event between 2090 and 2099, with limited evidence and low agreement that coral acclimation and/or adaptation will limit this trend.’‘The onset of global dissolution [of coral reefs] is at an atmospheric CO2 [concentration] of 560 ppm (medium confidence) and dissolution will be widespread in 2100’ (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5, medium confidence).‘A number of coral reefs could therefore keep up with the maximum rate of sea level rise (SLR) of 15.1 mm yr–1 projected for the end of the century [...], but lower net accretion [...] and increased turbidity will weaken this capability (very high confidence).’SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a; IPCC, 2019c)‘Climate change [...] has emerged as the greatest threat to coral reefs, with temperatures of just 1°C above the long-term summer maximum for an area (reference period 1985–1993) over 4–6 weeks being enough to cause mass coral bleaching [...] and mortality (very high confidence).’Predictions of back-to-back bleaching events have become reality over 2015–2017 as have projections of declining coral abundance (high confidence).‘Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the majority (70–90%) of warm water (tropical) coral reefs that exist today will disappear even if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C (very high confidence).’Coral reefs, for example, are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (&gt;99%) at 2°C (very high confidence).SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)‘New evidence since AR5 and SR15 confirms the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on coral reefs (high confidence), enhancing reef dissolution and bioerosion (high confidence), affecting coral species distribution and leading to community changes (high confidence). The rate of SLR (primarily noticed in small reef islands) may outpace the growth of reefs to keep up, although there is low agreement in the literature (low confidence).’‘Reefs are further exposed to other increased impacts, such as enhanced storm intensity, turbidity and increased runoff from the land (high confidence). Recovery of coral reefs resulting from repeated disturbance events is slow (high confidence). Only few coral reef areas show some resilience to global change drivers (low confidence).’‘Coral reefs will face very high risk at temperatures 1.5°C of global sea surface warming (very high confidence).’‘Almost all coral reefs will degrade from their current state, even if global warming remains below 2°C (very high confidence), and the remaining shallow coral reef communities will differ in species composition and diversity from present reefs (very high confidence). This will greatly diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence).’‘The very high vulnerability of coral reefs to warming, ocean acidification, increasing storm intensity and SLR under climate change, including enhanced bioerosion (high confidence), points to the importance of considering both mitigation and adaptation.’4133Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesfringed shorelines and reef islands (Yates et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2018). Local coral reef fish species richness is projected to decline due to the impacts of warming on coral cover and diversity (high confidence), with declines up to 40% by 2060 in SSP5-8.5 (Strona et al., 2021).These  observed  and  projected  impacts  are  supported  by  geological and paleo-ecological evidence showing a decline in coral reef extent and species richness under previous episodes of climate change and ocean acidification (Kiessling and Simpson, 2011; Pandolfi et al., 2011; Kiessling et al., 2012; Pandolfi and Kiessling, 2014; Kiessling and Kocsis, 2015). Major reef crises in the past 300 million years were governed by  hyperthermal  events  (medium  confidence)  (Section  3.2.4.4; Cross-Chapter  Box  PALEO  in  Chapter  1)  longer  in  time  scale  than anthropogenic climate change, during which net coral reef accretion was more strongly affected than biodiversity (medium confidence).In  response  to  the  global-scale  decline  in  coral  reefs  and  high future  risk,  recent  literature  focuses  on  finding  thermal  refuges  and identifying uniquely resilient species, populations or reefs for targeted restoration  and  management  (Hoegh-Guldberg  et  al.,  2018b).  Reefs exposed to internal waves (Storlazzi et al., 2020), turbidity (Sully and van  Woesik,  2020)  or  warm-season  cloudiness  (Gonzalez-Espinosa and  Donner,  2021)  are  expected  to  be  less  sensitive  to  thermal stress.  Mesophotic  reefs  (30–150 m)  have  also  been  proposed  as thermal  refugia  (Bongaerts  et  al.,  2010),  although  evidence  from recent bleaching events, subsurface temperature records and species overlap is mixed (Frade et al., 2018; Rocha et al., 2018b; Eakin et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2019; Wyatt et al., 2020). A study of 2584 reef sites  across  the  Indian  and  Pacific  oceans  estimated  that  17%  had sufficient  cover  of  framework-building  corals  to  warrant  protection, 54% required recovery efforts and 28% were on a path to net erosion (Darling et al., 2019). There is medium evidence for greater bleaching resistance among reefs subject to temperature variability or frequent heat  stress  (Barkley  et  al.,  2018;  Gintert  et  al.,  2018;  Hughes  et  al., 2018a; Morikawa and Palumbi, 2019), but with trade-offs in terms of diversity  and  structural  complexity  (Donner  and  Carilli,  2019;  Magel et  al.,  2019).  There  is  limited  agreement  about  the  persistence  of thermal tolerance in response to severe heat stress (Le Nohaïc et al., 2017; DeCarlo et al., 2019; Fordyce et al., 2019; Leggat et al., 2019; Schoepf et al., 2020). Recovery and restoration efforts that target heat-resistant coral populations and culture heat-tolerant algal symbionts have  the  greatest  potential  of  effectiveness  under  future  warming (high confidence) (see Box 5.5 in SROCC Chapter 5; Bay et al., 2017; Darling  and  Côté,  2018;  Baums  et  al.,  2019;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a; Howells et al., 2021); however, there is low confidence that enhanced thermal  tolerance  can  be  sustained  over  time  (Section  3.6.3.3.2; Buerger  et  al.,  2020).  The  effectiveness  of  active  restoration  and other specific interventions (e.g., reef shading) are further assessed in Section 3.6.3.3.2.In  summary,  additional  evidence  since  SROCC  and  SR15  (Table  3.3) finds that living coral and reef growth are declining due to warming and  MHWs  (very  high  confidence).  Coral  reefs  are  under  threat  of transitioning  to  net  erosion  with  &gt;1.5°C  of  global  warming  (high confidence),  with  impacts  expected  to  occur  fastest  in  the  Atlantic Ocean.  The  effectiveness  of  conservation  efforts  to  sustain  living coral area, coral diversity and reef growth is limited for the majority of the world’s reefs with &gt;1.5°C of global warming (high confidence) (Section 3.6.3.3.2; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018b; Bruno et al., 2019; Darling et al., 2019).3.4.2.2 Rocky ShoresRocky  shore  ecosystems  refer  to  a  range  of  temperate  intertidal and  shallow  coastal  ecosystems  that  are  dominated  by  different foundational organisms, including mussels, oysters, fleshy macroalgae, hard  and  soft  corals,  coralline  algae,  bryozoans  and  sponges,  which create  habitat  for  species-rich  assemblages  of  invertebrates,  fish, marine mammals and other organisms. Rocky shores provide services including wave attenuation, habitat provision and food resources, and these  support  commercial, recreational  and  Indigenous  fisheries and shellfish aquaculture.Observations since AR5 and SROCC (Table 3.4) find increased impacts of ocean warming on rocky shores. This includes extirpation of species at the warm edge of their ranges (Yeruham et al., 2015; Martínez et al., 2018), extension of poleward range boundaries (Sanford et al., 2019), mortality  from  climate  extremes  (Seuront  et  al.,  2019),  reduction  in survival at shallower depths (Sorte et al., 2019; Wallingford and Sorte, 2019) and reorganisation of communities (Wilson et al., 2019; Mulders and Wernberg, 2020; Albano et al., 2021). Data collected after MHWs find  ecological  phase  shifts  (moderate  evidence,  high  agreement) (e.g., California; Rogers-Bennett and Catton, 2019; McPherson et al., 2021)  and  homogenisation  of  communities  (limited  evidence)  (e.g., Alaska; Weitzman et al., 2021). For example, the collapse of sea star populations  in  the  Northeast  Pacific  due  to  a  MHW-related  disease outbreak (Hewson et al., 2014; Menge et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2018; Schiebelhut  et  al.,  2018),  including  80–100%  loss  of  the  common predatory  sunflower  star,  Pycnopodia  helianthoides  (very  high confidence) (Harvell et al., 2019), triggered shifts from kelp- to urchin-dominated  ecosystems  (Schultz  et  al.,  2016;  Gravem  and  Morgan, 2017; McPherson et al., 2021).Multiple lines of evidence find that foundational calcifying organisms such as mussels are at high risk of decline due to both the individual and  synergistic  effects  of  warming,  acidification  and  hypoxia  (high confidence) (Sunday et al., 2016; Sorte et al., 2017; Sorte et al., 2019; Newcomb  et  al.,  2020).  Warmer  temperatures  reduce  mussel  and barnacle recruitment (e.g., northwest Atlantic; Petraitis and Dudgeon, 2020) and the upper vertical limit of mussels (e.g., northeast Pacific, Harley, 2011; and southwest Pacific, Sorte et al., 2019). Experiments show  that  ocean  acidification  negatively  impacts  mussel  physiology (very  high  confidence),  with  evidence  of  reduced  growth  (Gazeau et  al.,  2010),  attachment  (Newcomb  et  al.,  2020),  biomineralisation (Fitzer  et  al.,  2014)  and  shell  thickness  (Pfister  et  al.,  2016;  McCoy et  al.,  2018).  Net  calcification  and  abundance  of  mussels  and  other foundational species, including oysters, are expected to decline due to ocean acidification (very high confidence) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; Sunday et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2018), causing the  reorganisation  of  communities  (high  confidence)  (Kroeker  et  al., 2013b;  Linares  et  al.,  2015;  Brown  et  al.,  2016;  Sunday  et  al.,  2016; Agostini  et al.,  2018; Teixidó  et al., 2018). Experiments  indicate that acidification  can  interact  with  warming  and  hypoxia  to  increase  the 414Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Coral reef futureswith and without adaptationRCP2.6RCP4.5RCP6.0RCP8.5Mean coral reef SST anomaly 00.5°C1°C1.5°C2°C2.5°C3°C100sfeeryhtlaeH%806040200(i) No adaptation (ii) With adaptationaabcbc(a) Historical coral reef (b) Low diversity reef-(c) Degraded coral reef195020002050210019502000205021003High coral cover and diversity; high physical complexity and reef growth;high fish biomass and diversityModerate cover composed of few,heat-tolerant taxa; lower complexityand growth rate; lower fish diversityLimited cover with few species; lowcomplexity with limited growth; lowfish biomass and diversityFigure  3.13  |    Coral  reef  futures,  with  and  without  adaptation.  Graphs  are  based  on  a  model  of  coral-symbiont  evolutionary  dynamics  from  Logan  et  al.  (2021), which simulates two coral types and symbiont populations for 1925 reef cells worldwide, from 1950 to 2100 drawn from simulations with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration–Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM2M) under four RCPs. Top panels show the simulated fraction of cells with healthy reefs, when both coral types are not in a state of severe bleaching or mortality, (i) without adaptive responses and (ii) with adaptive responses (symbiont evolution). Colours indicate maximum monthly sea surface temperature increase across all reef cells, versus a 1861–2010 baseline. Panels (a,b,c) depict snapshots of coral reef conditions at time points in the future, each with different levels of warming, drawn from the model-projected cover of the two coral types and from a literature assessment (Section 3.4.2.1; Hughes et al., 2018b; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Darling et al., 2019; Leggat et al., 2019; Cornwall et al., 2021).detrimental effects on mussels (Gu et al., 2019; Newcomb et al., 2020). In  regions  where  food  is  readily  available  to  mussels,  detrimental effects of ocean acidification may be dampened (Kroeker et al., 2016); however, recent findings are inconclusive (Brown et al., 2018a).Coralline algae, foundational taxa that create habitat for sea urchins and  abalone,  form  rhodolith  beds  in  temperate  to  Arctic  habitats and bind together substrates, are expected to be highly susceptible to  ocean  acidification  because  they  precipitate  soluble  magnesium calcite  (Kuffner  et  al.,  2008;  Williams  et  al.,  2021).  Damage  from acidification  varies  among  species  and  regions,  and  can  be  due  to direct physiological stress (Marchini et al., 2019) or interactions with non-calcifying competitors  such as  fleshy macroalgae (Smith  et al., 2020).  Experiments  indicate  that  warming  reduces  calcification by  coralline  algae  (high  confidence)  (Cornwall  et  al.,  2019)  and exacerbates  the  effect  of  acidification  (Kim  et  al.,  2020;  Williams et al., 2021).In contrast to warm-water coral reefs, there are no regional or global numerical  models  of  rocky  shore  ecosystem  response  to  projected climate  change  and  acidification.  Experiments  suggest  that  existing genetic  variation  could  be  sufficient  for  some  mussels  (Bitter  et  al., 2019)  and  coralline  algae  (Cornwall  et  al.,  2020)  to  adapt  over generations  to  ocean  acidification.  Populations  exposed  to  variable environments often have a greater capacity for phenotypic plasticity and  resilience  to  environmental  change  [e.g.,  urchins  (Gaitan-Espitia et al., 2017b) and coralline algae (Section 3.3.2; Rivest et al., 2017; Cornwall et al., 2018)]. Although parental conditioning within and  across  generations  is  an  acclimatisation  mechanism  to  global change, there is limited evidence from experimental studies that this is  applicable  for  marine  invertebrates  on  rocky  shores  (Byrne  et  al., 2020).This assessment concludes that MHWs attributable to climate change (Section 3.2.2.1) can cause fatal disease outbreaks or mass mortality among some key foundational species (high confidence) and contribute 415  Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesFrequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 3.2 | How are marine heatwaves affecting marine life and human communities?Heatwaves happen in the ocean as well as in the atmosphere. Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extended periods of unusually warm ocean temperatures relative to the typical temperatures for that location and time of year. Due to climate change, the number of days with MHWs has increased by 54% over the past century. These MHWs cause mortalities in a wide variety of marine species, from corals to kelp to seagrasses to fish to seabirds, and have consequent effects on ecosystems and industries like aquaculture and fisheries.Extreme events in the ocean can have damaging effects on marine ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. The most common form of ocean extremes are MHWs, which are becoming more frequent and intense  due  to  global  warming.  Because  seawater  absorbs  and  releases  heat  more  slowly  than  air,  temperature extremes in the ocean are not as pronounced as over land, but they can persist for much longer, often for weeks to months over areas covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. These MHWs can be more detrimental for marine species, in comparison with land species, because marine species are usually adapted to relatively stable temperatures.A  commonly  used  definition  of  MHWs  is  a  period  of  at  least  5  days  whose  temperatures  are  warmer  than  90% of the historical records for that location and time of year. Marine heatwaves are described by their abruptness, magnitude, duration, intensity and other metrics. In addition, targeted methods are used to characterize MHWs that threaten particular ecosystems; for example, the accumulated heat stress above typical summer temperatures, described by ‘degree heating weeks’, is used to estimate the likelihood of coral bleaching.3Over the past century, MHWs have doubled in frequency, become more intense, lasted for longer and extended over larger areas. Marine heatwaves have occurred in every ocean region over the past few decades, most markedly in association with regional climate phenomena such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. During the 2015–2016 El Niño event, 70% of the world’s ocean surface encountered MHWs.Such MHWs cause mortality of a wide variety of marine species, from corals to kelp to seagrasses to fish to seabirds, and they have consequent effects on ecosystems and industries such as mariculture and fisheries. Warm-water coral reefs, estuarine seagrass meadows and cold-temperate kelp forests are among the ecosystems most threatened by MHWs since they are attached to the seafloor (see FAQ 3.2). Unusually warm temperatures cause bleaching and associated death of warm-water corals, which can lead to shifts to low-diversity or algae-dominated reefs, changes in fish communities and deterioration of the physical reef structure, which causes habitat loss and increases the vulnerability of nearby shorelines to large-wave events and SLR. Since the early 1980s, the frequency and severity of mass coral bleaching events have increased sharply worldwide. For example, from 2016 through 2020, the Great Barrier Reef experienced mass coral bleaching three times in 5 years.Mass loss of kelp from MHWs effects on the canopy-forming species has occurred across ocean basins, including the  coasts  of  Japan,  Canada,  Mexico,  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  In  southern  Norway  and  the  northeast  USA, mortality from MHWs contributed to the decline of sugar kelp over the past two decades and the spread of turf algal ecosystems that prevent recolonisation by the original canopy-forming species.One  of  the  largest  and  longest-duration  MHWs,  nicknamed  the  ‘Blob’,  occurred  in  the  Northeast  Pacific  Ocean, extending from California north towards the Bering Sea, from 2013 through 2015. Warming from the MHW persisted into 2016 off the West Coast of the USA and into 2018 in the deeper waters of a Canadian fjord. The consequent effects  of  this  expansive  MHW  included  widespread  shifts  in  abundance,  distribution  and  nutritional  value  of invertebrates and fish, a bloom of toxic algae off the West Coast of the USA that impacted fisheries, the decline of California kelp forests that contributed to the collapse of the abalone fishery, and mass mortality of seabirds.The projected increase in the frequency, severity, duration and areal extent of MHWs threaten many marine species and ecosystems. These MHWs may exceed the thermal limits of species, and they may occur too frequently for the species to acclimate or for populations to recover. The majority of the world’s coral reefs are projected to decline and begin eroding due to more frequent bleaching-level MHWs if the world warms by more than 1.5°C. Recent research suggests possible shifts to more heat-tolerant coral communities but at the expense of species and habitat diversity. Other systems, including kelp forests, are most threatened near the edges of their ranges, although more research is needed into the effect of re-occurring MHWs on kelp forests and other vulnerable systems.The projected ecological impacts of MHWs threaten local communities and Indigenous Peoples, incomes, fisheries, tourism and, in the case of coral reefs, shoreline protection from waves. High-resolution forecasts and early-warning 416Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box FAQ 3.2 (continued)systems, currently most advanced for coral reefs, can help people and industries prepare for MHWs and also collect data on their effects. Identifying and protecting locations and habitats with reduced exposure to MHWs is a key scientific endeavour. For example, corals may be protected from MHWs in tidally stirred waters or in reefs where cooler water upwells from subsurface. Marine protected areas and no-take zones, in addition to terrestrial protection surrounding vulnerable coastal ecosystems, cannot prevent MHWs from occurring. But, depending on the location and adherence by people to restrictions on certain activities, the cumulative effect of other stressors on vulnerable ecosystems can be reduced, potentially helping to enhance the rate of recovery of marine life.How are marine heatwaves affecting marine life and human communities?54%Due to climate change, ocean heatwave days have increased by 54% over the past century.

The  upper  vertical limits of some species will also be constrained by climate change (high confidence). Experimental evidence since previous assessments further indicates  that  acidification  decreases  abundance  and  richness  of calcifying species (high confidence), although there is limited evidence for  acclimation  in  some  species.  Synergistic  effects  of  warming  and acidification  will  promote  shifts  towards  macroalgal  dominance  in some ecosystems (medium confidence) and lead to reorganisation of communities (medium confidence).3.4.2.3 Kelp EcosystemsKelp are temperate, habitat-forming marine macroalgae or seaweeds, mostly  of  the  order  Laminariales,  which  extend  across  one-quarter  of  the  world’s  coastlines  (Assis  et  al.,  2020;  Jayathilake  and Costello,  2020). The  perennial  species  form  dense  underwater  forest canopies  and  three-dimensional  habitat  that  provides  refuge  for fish,  crustaceans,  invertebrates  and  marine  mammals  (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2016; Wernberg et al., 2019). Kelp ecosystems support fisheries, aquaculture,  fertiliser  and  food  provision,  including  for  local  and Indigenous Peoples, along with regulating services in the form of wave attenuation  and  habitat  provision.  Kelp  aquaculture  can  also  buffer against local acidification (Xiao et al., 2021) and contribute to carbon storage (Froehlich et al., 2019).Recent research (Straub et al., 2019; Butler et al., 2020; Filbee-Dexter et  al.,  2020b;  Tait  et  al.,  2021)  supports  the  findings  of  previous assessments (Table 3.5) that kelp and other seaweeds in most regions are  undergoing  mass  mortalities  from  high  temperature  extremes and  range  shifts  from  warming  (very  high  confidence).  Kelp  are highly  sensitive  to  the  direct  effect  of  high  temperature  on  survival (Nepper-Davidsen  et  al.,  2019)  and  indirect  impact  of  temperature on  herbivorous  species  (Ling,  2008;  Vergés  et  al.,  2016),  upwelling and  nutrient  availability  (Carr  and  Reed,  2015;  Schiel  and  Foster, 2015). Synergies between warming, storms, pollution and intensified herbivory (due to removal or loss of predators including sea stars and otters  that  constrain  herbivory  by  fish  and  urchin  populations)  can also cause physiological stress and physical damage in kelp, reducing productivity  and  reproduction  (Rogers-Bennett  and  Catton,  2019; Beas-Luna et al., 2020; McPherson et al., 2021).Trends in kelp abundance since 1950 are uneven globally (Krumhansl et  al.,  2016;  Wernberg  et  al.,  2019),  with  population  declines  (e.g., giant  kelp  Macrocystis  pyrifera  in Tasmania,  Butler  et  al.,  2020;  and 3Table 3.4 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of rocky shoresObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)‘Rocky shores are among the better-understood coastal ecosystems in terms of potential impacts of climate variability and change. The most prominent effects are range shifts of species in response to ocean warming (high confidence) and changes in species distribution and abundance (high confidence) mostly in relation to ocean warming and acidification.’‘The dramatic decline of biodiversity in mussel beds of the Californian coast has been attributed to large-scale processes associated with climate-related drivers [...] (high confidence).’‘The abundance and distribution of rocky shore species will continue to change in a warming world (high confidence). For example, the long-term consequences of ocean warming on mussel beds of the northeast Pacific are both positive (increased growth) and negative (increased susceptibility to stress and of exposure to predation) (medium confidence).’‘Observations performed near natural CO2 vents in the Mediterranean Sea show that diversity, biomass and trophic complexity of rocky shore communities will decrease at future pH levels (high confidence).’SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a)‘Changes in ocean circulation can have profound impacts on [temperate] marine ecosystems by connecting regions and facilitating the entry and establishment of species in areas where they were unknown before (‘tropicalization’ ...) as well as the arrival of novel disease agents (medium agreement, limited evidence).’‘In the transition to 1.5°C, changes to water temperatures are expected to drive some species (e.g., plankton, fish) to relocate to higher latitudes and cause novel ecosystems to assemble (high confidence). Other ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) are relatively less able to move, however, and are projected to experience high rates of mortality and loss (very high confidence).’‘In the case of ‘less mobile’ ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, kelp forests, intertidal communities), shifts in biogeographic ranges may be limited, with mass mortalities and disease outbreaks increasing in frequency as the exposure to extreme temperatures increases’ (high agreement, robust evidence).SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Intertidal rocky shores ecosystems are highly sensitive to ocean warming, acidification and extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion (high confidence).‘Sessile calcified organisms (e.g., barnacles and mussels) in intertidal rocky shores are highly sensitive to extreme temperature events and acidification (high confidence), a reduction in their biodiversity and abundance have been observed in naturally acidified rocky reef ecosystems (medium confidence).’‘Intertidal rocky shores are also expected to be at very high risk (transition above 3°C) under the RCP8.5 scenario (medium confidence). These ecosystems have low to moderate adaptive capacity, as they are highly sensitive to ocean temperatures and acidification.’‘Benthic species will continue to relocate in the intertidal zones and experience mass mortality events due to warming (high confidence). Interactive effects between acidification and warming will exacerbate the negative impacts on rocky shore communities, causing a shift towards a less diverse ecosystem in terms of species richness and complexity, increasingly dominated by macroalgae (high confidence).’418Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3sugar  kelp  Saccharina  latissima  in  the  North  Atlantic,  Filbee-Dexter et al., 2020b) more common than increases or no change (e.g., giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in southern Chile; Friedlander et al., 2020). Warming is driving range contraction and extirpation at the warm edge of species’ ranges and expansions at the cold range edge (very high confidence) (Smale, 2019; Filbee-Dexter et al., 2020b). Local declines in populations of kelp and other canopy-forming seaweeds driven by MHWs and other stressors have caused irreversible shifts to turf- or urchin-dominated ecosystems, with lower productivity and biodiversity (high  confidence)  (Filbee-Dexter  and  Scheibling,  2014;  Filbee-Dexter and  Wernberg,  2018;  Rogers-Bennett  and  Catton,  2019;  Beas-Luna et al., 2020; Stuart-Smith et al., 2021), ecosystems dominated by warm-affinity seaweeds or coral (high confidence) (Vergés et al., 2019), and loss of genetic diversity (Coleman et al., 2020a; Gurgel et al., 2020).Species  distribution  models  of  kelp  project  range  shifts  and  local extirpations  with  increasing  levels  of  warming  (Japan:  Takao  et  al., 2015,  Sudo  et  al.,  2020;  Australia:  see  Table  11.6,  and  Assis  et  al., 2018,  Martínez  et  al.,  2018,  Castro  et  al.,  2020;  Europe:  de  la  Hoz et  al.,  2019;  North America: Wilson  et  al.,  2019;  South America:  see Figure  12.3).  There  is  high  agreement  on  the  direction  but  not  the magnitude of change (Martínez et al., 2018; Castro et al., 2020), but effects of MHWs are not simulated. Where the length of higher-latitude coastlines is limited, range contractions are projected to occur, even with 2°C of global warming (i.e., SSP1-2.6) due to loss of habitat at the  warm  edge  of  species’  ranges  (Martínez  et  al.,  2018).  Poleward expansion of warm-affinity herbivores, including urchins, could further reduce warm-edge kelp populations (Castro et al., 2020; Mulders and Wernberg, 2020). Evidence from natural temperate CO2 seeps suggests that ocean acidification at levels above those in RCP4.5 in 2100 could offset  the  increase  in  urchin  abundance  (Coni  et  al.,  2021).  Genetic analyses  suggest  that  kelp  populations  at  the  midpoint  of  species’ ranges  will  have  lower  tolerance  of  warming  than  that  implied  by species  distribution  models,  without  assisted  gene  flow  from  warm-edge populations (King et al., 2019; Wood et al., 2021).While  reducing  non-climate  drivers  can  help  prevent  kelp  loss  from warming and MHWs, there is limited potential for restoration of kelp ecosystems  after  transition  to  urchin-dominant  ecosystems  (high confidence).  Current  restoration  efforts  are  generally  small  scale (&lt;0.1 km2)  and  less  advanced  than  those  in  ecosystems  like  coral reefs  (Coleman  et  al.,  2020b;  Eger  et  al.,  2020;  Layton  et  al.,  2020). Although  abundance  of  herbivores  limits  kelp  populations,  there  is limited  evidence  that  restoring  predators  of  herbivores  by  creating marine  reserves,  or  directly  removing  grazing  species,  will  increase kelp  forest  resilience  to  warming  and  extremes  (Vergés  et  al.,  2019; Wernberg  et  al.,  2019).  Active  reseeding  of  wild  kelp  populations through transplantation and propagation of warm-tolerant genotypes (Coleman  et  al.,  2020b; Alsuwaiyan  et  al.,  2021)  can  overcome  low dispersal rates of many kelp species and facilitate effective restoration (medium confidence) (Morris et al., 2020c).Building on the conclusions of SROCC, this assessment finds that kelp ecosystems are expected to decline and undergo changes in community structure in the future due to warming and increasing frequency and intensity of MHWs (high confidence). Risk of loss of kelp ecosystems 3Table 3.5 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of kelp ecosystemsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)ObservationsProjections‘Kelp forests have been reported to decline in temperate areas in both hemispheres, a loss involving climate change (high confidence).

Although these coastal ecosystems have historically been sensitive to erosion-accretion cycles driven by sea level, drought and storms (high confidence) (Peteet et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018c; Jones et al., 2019b; Urrego  et  al.,  2019;  Hapsari  et  al.,  2020;  Zhao  et  al.,  2020b),  they were impacted for much of the 20th century primarily by non-climate drivers  (very  high  confidence)  (Brown  et  al.,  2018b;  Ducrotoy  et  al., 2019; Elliott et al., 2019; He and Silliman, 2019; Andersen et al., 2020; Newton  et  al.,  2020;  Stein  et  al.,  2020).  Nevertheless,  the  influence of  climate-induced  drivers  has  become  more  apparent  over  recent decades (medium confidence) (Table 3.6).3Estuarine biota are sensitive to warming (high confidence), with recent responses including changes in abundance of some fish stocks (Erickson et  al.,  2021; Woodland  et  al.,  2021),  poleward  shifts  in  distributions of fish species, communities and associated biogeographic transition zones (Table 12.3; Franco et al., 2020; Troast et al., 2020), recruits of warm-affinity species persisting into winter (Kimball et al., 2020) and changes  in  seasonal  timing  of  peaks  in  species  abundance  (Kimball et al., 2020). MHWs can be more severe in estuaries than in adjacent coastal seas (Lonhart et al., 2019), causing conspicuous impacts (very high  confidence),  including  mass  mortality  of  intertidal  vegetation (Section  3.4.2.5),  range  shifts  in  algae  and  animals  (Lonhart  et  al., 2019)  and  reduced  spawning  success  among  invertebrates  (Shanks et al., 2020).Relative SLR extends the upstream limit of saline waters (high confidence) (Harvey  et  al.,  2020;  Jiang  et  al.,  2020)  and  alters  tidal  ranges  (high confidence) (Idier et al., 2019; Talke et al., 2020). Elevated water levels also alter submergence patterns for intertidal habitat (high confidence) (Andres et al., 2019), moving high-water levels inland (high confidence) (Peteet et al., 2018; Appeaning Addo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020e) and increasing the salinity of coastal water tables and soils (high confidence) (Eswar  et  al.,  2021).  These  processes  favour  inland  and/or  upstream migration of intertidal habitat, where it is unconstrained by infrastructure, topography or other environmental features (high confidence) (Kirwan and Gedan, 2019; Parker and Boyer, 2019; Langston et al., 2020; Magolan and Halls, 2020; Saintilan et al., 2020). The spread of ‘ghost forests’ along the North American east coast (Kirwan and Gedan, 2019) and elsewhere (Grieger  et  al.,  2020)  illustrates  this  phenomenon.  Along  estuarine shorelines,  changing  submergence  patterns  and  upstream  penetration of  saline  waters  interact  synergistically  to  stress  intertidal  plants, changing  species  composition  and  reducing  above-ground  biomass, in some cases favouring invasive species (Xue et al., 2018; Buffington et al., 2020; Gallego-Tévar et al., 2020). Overall, changing salinity and submergence  patterns  decrease  the  ability  of  shoreline  vegetation  to trap sediment (Xue et al., 2018), reducing accretion rates and increasing 420Drought  and  freshwater  abstraction  can  reduce  freshwater  inflows to  estuaries  and  lagoons,  increasing  salinity,  reducing  water  quality (Brooker  and  Scharler,  2020)  and  depleting  resident  macrophyte communities (Scanes et al., 2020b). Changes in freshwater input and SLR, combined with land-use change, can alter inputs of land-based sediments, causing expansion (Suyadi et al., 2019; Magolan and Halls, 2020) or contraction (Andres et al., 2019; Appeaning Addo et al., 2020; Li  et  al.,  2020b)  of  intertidal  habitats.  The  same  phenomena  alter salinity gradients, which are the primary drivers of estuarine species distributions  (high  confidence)  (Douglass  et  al.,  2020;  Lauchlan  and Nagelkerken, 2020). Extreme reduction of freshwater input can extend residence time of estuarine water, leading to persistent HABs (Lehman et al.,  2020) and converting  estuaries to lagoons if  the  mouth clogs with sediment (Thom et al., 2020).Acidification of estuarine water is a growing hazard (medium confidence) (Doney et al., 2020; Scanes et al., 2020a; Cai et al., 2021), and resident organisms  display  sensitivity  to  altered  pH  in  laboratory  settings (medium  confidence)  (Young  et  al.,  2019a;  Morrell  and  Gobler,  2020; Pardo  and  Costa,  2021).  However,  attribution  of  the  biological  effects of  acidification  is  difficult  because  many  biogeochemical  processes affect estuarine carbon chemistry (Sections 3.2.3.1, 3.3.2). Warming can exacerbate the impacts of both acidification and hypoxia on estuarine organisms (Baumann and Smith, 2018; Collins et al., 2019b; Ni et al., 2020). These effects are further complicated by eutrophication, with high nitrogen loads associated with lower pH (Rheuban et al., 2019). Warming (including  MHWs)  and  eutrophication  interact  to  decrease  estuarine oxygen content and pH, increasing the vulnerability of animals to MHWs (Brauko et al., 2020) and exacerbating the incidence and impact of dead zones  (medium  confidence)  (Altieri  and  Gedan,  2015). The  impacts  of storms on estuaries are variable and are described in SM3.3.1.All  these  impacts  are  projected  to  escalate  under  future  climate change,  but  their  magnitude  depends  on  the  amount  of  warming, the  socioeconomic  development  pathway  and  implementation  of adaptation strategies (medium confidence). Modelling studies (Lopes et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2019; White et al., 2019; Zhang and Li, 2019; Hong et al., 2020; Krvavica and Ružić, 2020; Liu et al., 2020e; Shalby  et  al.,  2020)  suggest  that  responses  of  estuaries  to  SLR  will be  complex  and  context  dependent  (Khojasteh  et  al.,  2021),  but project  that  salinity,  tidal  range,  storm-surge  amplitude,  depth  and stratification  will  increase  with  SLR  (medium  confidence),  and  that marine-dominated  waters  will  penetrate  farther  upstream  (high confidence).  Without  careful  management  of  freshwater  inputs, sediment augmentation and/or the restoration of shorelines to more natural states, transformation and loss of intertidal areas and wetland vegetation  will  increase  with  SLR  (high  confidence)  (Doughty  et  al., 2019; Leuven et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Raw et al., 2020; Shih, 2020; Stein et al., 2020), with small, shallow microtidal estuaries being more vulnerable  to  impacts  than  deeper  estuaries  with  well-developed sediments (medium confidence) (Leuven et al., 2019; Williamson and Guinder,  2021). Warming  and  MHWs  will  enhance  stratification  and deoxygenation in shallow lagoons (medium confidence) (Derolez et al., 2020) and will continue to drive range shifts among estuarine biota Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.6 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of estuaries, deltas and coastal lagoonsObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)Humans have impacted lagoons, estuaries and deltas (high to very high confidence), but non-climate drivers have been the primary agents of change (very high confidence).In estuaries and lagoons, nutrient inputs have driven eutrophication, which has modified food-web structures (high confidence) and caused more-intense and longer-lasting hypoxia, more-frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms and enhanced emissions of nitrous oxide (high confidence).In deltas, land-use changes and associated disruption of sediment dynamics and land subsidence have driven changes that have been exacerbated by relative SLR and episodic events, including river floods and oceanic storm surges (very high confidence).Increased coastal flooding, erosion and saltwater intrusions have led to degradation of ecosystems (very high confidence).Future changes in climate impact-drivers such as warming, acidification, waves, storms, sea level rise (SLR) and runoff will have consequences for ecosystem function and services in lagoons and estuaries (high confidence), but with regional differences in magnitude of change in impact drivers and ecosystem response.Warming, changes in precipitation and changes in wind strength can interact to alter water-column salinity and stratification (medium confidence), which could impact water column oxygen content (medium confidence).Land-use change, SLR and intensifying storms will alter deposition-erosion dynamics, impacting shoreline vegetation and altering turbidity (medium confidence). Together with warming, these drivers will alter the seasonal pattern of primary production and the distribution of biota throughout the ecosystems (medium to high confidence), impacting associated ecosystem services.The projected impacts of climate change on deltas are associated mainly with pluvial floods and SLR, which will amplify observed impacts of interacting climate and non-climate drivers (high confidence).SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a)Estuaries, deltas and lagoons were not assessed in this report.3Under both a 1.5°C and 2°C of warming, relative to the pre-industrial era, deltas are expected to be highly threatened by SLR and localised subsidence (high confidence). The slower rate of SLR associated with 1.5°C of warming poses smaller risks of flooding and salinisation (high confidence), and facilitates greater opportunities for adaptation, including managing and restoring natural coastal ecosystems and infrastructure reinforcement (medium confidence).[Intact coastal ecosystems] ‘may be effective in reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence).’‘Natural sedimentation rates are expected to be able to offset the effect of rising sea levels, given the slower rates of SLR associated with 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Other feedbacks, such as landward migration of wetlands and the adaptation of infrastructure, remain important (medium confidence).’SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Increased seawater intrusion caused by SLR has driven upstream redistribution of marine biotic communities in estuaries (medium confidence) where physical barriers, such as the availability of benthic substrates, do not limit availability of suitable habitats (medium confidence).Warming has driven poleward range shifts in species’ distributions among estuaries (medium confidence).Interactions between warming, eutrophication and hypoxia have increased the incidence of harmful algal blooms (high confidence), pathogenic bacteria, such as Vibrio species, (low confidence) and mortalities of invertebrates and fish communities (medium confidence).‘Salinisation and expansion of hypoxic conditions will intensify in eutrophic estuaries, especially in mid and high latitudes with microtidal regimes (high confidence).’‘The effects of warming will be more pronounced in high-latitude and temperate shallow estuaries with limited exchange with the open ocean [...] and seasonality that already leads to dead zone development [...] (medium confidence).’Interaction between SLR and changes in precipitation will have greater impacts on shallow than deep estuaries (medium confidence).Estuaries characterised by large tidal exchanges and associated well-developed sediments will be more resilient to projected SLR and changes in river flow (medium confidence). Human activities that inhibit sediment dynamics in coastal deltas increase their vulnerability to SLR (medium confidence).(medium  confidence)  (Veldkornet  and  Rajkaran,  2019;  Zhang  et  al., 2020c),  resulting  in  extirpations  where  thermal  habitat  is  lost  and potentially generating new habitat for warm-affinity species (limited evidence, medium agreement) (Veldkornet and Rajkaran, 2019).2019;  Rogers  et  al.,  2019)  and  provide  an  extensive  range  of  other ecosystem services (see Box 3.4). Because these ecosystems are often found  within  estuaries  and  along  sheltered  coastlines,  they  share vulnerabilities,  climate-induced  drivers  (Table  3.7)  and  non-climate drivers with estuaries and coastal lagoons (Section 3.4.2.4).3.4.2.5 Vegetated Blue Carbon EcosystemsMangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds (wetland ecosystems) are considered ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems due to their capacity to accumulate and store organic-carbon rich sediments (see Box 3.4; Macreadie et al., Since  AR5  and  SROCC,  syntheses  have  emphasised  that  the vulnerability of rooted wetland ecosystems to climate-induced drivers is exacerbated by non-climate drivers (high confidence) (Elliott et al., 2019; Ostrowski et al., 2021; Williamson and Guinder, 2021) and climate 421Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.7 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass bedsObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)Seagrasses occurring close to their upper thermal limits are already stressed by climate change (high confidence).‘Increased CO2 concentrations have increased seagrass photosynthetic rates by 20% (limited evidence, high agreement).’Climate change will drive ongoing declines in the extent of seagrasses in temperate waters (medium confidence) as well as poleward range expansions of seagrasses and mangroves, especially in the Northern Hemisphere (high confidence).Beneficial effects of elevated CO2 will increase seagrass productivity and carbon burial rates in salt marshes during the first half of the 21st century, but there is limited evidence that this will improve their survival or resistance to warming.As a result, interactions between climate change and non-climate drivers will continue to cause declines in estuarine vegetated systems (very high confidence).SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a)Vegetated blue carbon systems were not assessed in this report.3SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Oppenheimer et al., 2019)Intact wetland ecosystems can reduce the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying storms by protecting shorelines (medium confidence), and their degradation could reduce remaining carbon budgets by up to 100 GtCO2.Under 1.5°C of warming, natural sedimentation rates are projected to outpace SLR (medium confidence), but ‘other feedbacks, such as landward migration of wetlands and the adaptation of infrastructure, remain important (medium confidence).’Coastal ecosystems, including salt marshes, mangroves, vegetated dunes and sandy beaches, can build vertically and expand laterally in response to SLR, though this capacity varies across sites (high confidence). These ecosystems provide important services that include coastal protection and habitat for diverse biota. However, as a consequence of human actions that fragment wetland habitats and restrict landward migration, coastal ecosystems progressively lose their ability to adapt to climate-induced changes and provide ecosystem services, including acting as protective barriers (high confidence).’Warming and SLR-driven salinisation of wetlands are causing shifts in the distribution of plant species inland and poleward. Examples include mangrove encroachment into subtropical salt marshes (high confidence) and contraction in extent of low-latitude seagrass meadows (high confidence).Plants with low tolerance to flooding and extreme temperatures are particularly vulnerable, increasing the risk of extirpation (medium confidence).Extreme-weather events, including heatwaves, droughts and storms, are causing mass mortalities and changes in community composition in coastal wetlands (high confidence).Severe disturbance of wetlands or transitions among wetland community types can favour invasive species (medium confidence).The degradation or loss of vegetated coastal ecosystems reduces carbon storage, with positive feedbacks to the climate system (high confidence).‘Seagrass meadows (high confidence) [...] will face moderate to high risk at temperature above 1.5°C global sea surface warming.’‘The transition from undetectable to moderate risk in salt marshes [...] takes place between 0.7°C–1.2°C of global sea surface warming (medium/high confidence), and between 0.9°C–1.8°C (medium confidence) in sandy beaches, estuaries and mangrove forests.’‘The ecosystems at moderate to high risk under future emission scenarios are mangrove forests (transition from moderate to high risk at 2.5°C–2.7°C of global sea surface warming), estuaries and sandy beaches (2.3°C–3.0°C) and salt marshes (transition from moderate to high risk at 1.8°C–2.7°C and from high to very high risk at 3.0°C–3.4°C) (medium confidence).’‘Global coastal wetlands will lose between 20–90% of their area depending on emissions scenario with impacts on their contributions to carbon sequestration and coastal protection (high confidence).’Estuarine wetlands will remain resilient to modest rates of SLR where their sediment dynamics are unconstrained. But SLR and warming are projected to drive global loss of up to 90% of vegetated wetlands by the end of the century under the RCP8.5 (medium confidence), especially if landward migration and sediment supply are limited by human modification of shorelines and river flows (medium confidence).‘Moreover, pervasive coastal squeeze and human-driven habitat deterioration will reduce the natural capacity of these ecosystems to adapt to climate impacts (high confidence).’variability (high confidence) (Day and Rybczyk, 2019; Kendrick et al., 2019; Shields et al., 2019). Global rates of mangrove loss have been extensive but are slowing (high confidence) at least partially due to management interventions (Friess et al., 2020b; Goldberg et al., 2020). From 2000 to 2010 mangrove loss averaged 0.16% yr–1, globally, but with greatest loss in Southeast Asia (high confidence) (Hamilton and Casey, 2016; Friess et al., 2019; Goldberg et al., 2020) and ubiquitous fragmentation  leaving  few  mangroves  intact  (Bryan-Brown  et  al., 2020). Salt-marsh ecosystems have also suffered extensive losses (up to 60% in places since the 1980s), especially in developed and rapidly developing countries (medium confidence) (Table 12.3; Gu et al., 2018; Stein et al., 2020). Similarly, 29% of seagrass meadows were lost from 1879–to 2006 due primarily to coastal development and degradation of water quality, with climate-change impacts escalating since 1990 (medium confidence) (Waycott et al., 2009; Sousa et al., 2019; Derolez et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021a). Local examples of habitat stability or growth (e.g., de los Santos et al., 2019; Laengner et al., 2019; Sousa et al., 2019; Suyadi et al., 2019; Derolez et al., 2020; Goldberg et al., 2020; McKenzie and Yoshida, 2020) indicate some resilience to climate change  in  the  absence  of  non-climate  drivers  (high  confidence). Nevertheless,  previous  declines  have  left  wetland  ecosystems  more vulnerable  to  impacts  from  climate-induced  drivers  and  non-climate drivers (high confidence) (Friess et al., 2019; Williamson and Guinder, 2021).Warming  and  MHWs  have  affected  the  range,  species  composition and survival of some wetland ecosystems. Warming is allowing some, but not all (Rogers and Krauss, 2018; Saintilan et al., 2018), mangrove 422Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.8 |  Estimates of vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea level rise (SLR) on the basis of sediment coresRegionHabitatReferenceRates of SLR at which habitat loss isWGI AR6 Table 9.9 median estimate (and likely range) of SLR (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021)LikelyVery likely2040–20602080–2100GlobalMangroveSaintilan et al.

This  expansion  can  affect  species interactions  (Guo  et  al.,  2017;  Friess  et  al.,  2019),  and  enhance sediment  accretion  and  carbon  storage  rates  in  some  instances (medium confidence) (Guo et al., 2017; Kelleway et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018b; Coldren et al., 2019; Raw et al., 2019). Drought, low sea levels  and  MHWs  can  cause  significant  die-offs  among  mangroves (medium  confidence)  (Lovelock  et  al.,  2017b;  Duke  et  al.,  2021). Seagrasses  are  similarly  vulnerable  to  warming  (high  confidence) (Repolho et al., 2017; Duarte et al., 2018; Jayathilake and Costello, 2018; Savva et al., 2018), which has been attributed as one cause of observed changes in distribution and community structure (medium confidence)  (Hyndes  et  al.,  2016;  Nowicki  et  al.,  2017).  MHWs, together  with  storm-driven  turbidity  and  structural  damage,  can cause  seagrass  die-offs  (high  confidence)  (Arias-Ortiz  et  al.,  2018; Kendrick et al., 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Strydom et al., 2020), shifts to  small,  fast-growing  species  (high  confidence)  (Kendrick  et  al., 2019;  Shields  et  al.,  2019;  Strydom  et  al.,  2020)  and  ecosystem collapse (Serrano et al., 2021).The  sensitivity  of  salt  marshes  and  mangroves  to  RSLR  depends  on whether they accrete inorganic sediment and/or organic material at rates equivalent to rising water levels (very high confidence) (Peteet et al., 2018; FitzGerald and Hughes, 2019; Friess et al., 2019; Gonneea et  al.,  2019;  Leo  et  al.,  2019;  Marx  et  al.,  2020;  Saintilan  et  al., 2020). Otherwise, wetland ecosystems must migrate either inland or upstream, or face gradual submergence in deeper, increasingly saline water  (very  high  confidence)  (Section  3.4.2.4;  Andres  et  al.,  2019; Jones  et  al.,  2019b;  Cohen  et  al.,  2020;  Mafi-Gholami  et  al.,  2020; Magolan and Halls, 2020; Sklar et al., 2021). Ability to migrate depends on local topography, the positioning of anthropogenic infrastructure and structures placed to defend such infrastructure (Schuerch et al., 2018;  Fagherazzi  et  al.,  2020;  Cahoon  et  al.,  2021).  Submergence drives changes in community structure (high confidence) (Jones et al., 2019b; Yu et al., 2019; Douglass et al., 2020; Langston et al., 2020) and  functioning  (high  confidence)  (Charles  et  al.,  2019;  Buffington et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2020), and will eventually lead to extirpation of the most sensitive vegetation (medium confidence) (Schepers et al., 2017; Scalpone et al., 2020) and associated animals (low confidence) (Rosencranz  et  al.,  2018).  The  impacts  of  storms  on  wetlands  are variable and described in SM3.3.1.As  noted  in  SROCC,  given  the  diversity  of  coastal  wetlands  as  well as the dependence of their future vulnerability to climate change on adaptation  pathways  (Krauss,  2021;  Rogers,  2021),  projections  of future impacts based on shoreline elevation estimated from satellite data  and  CMIP5  projections  (Spencer  et  al.,  2016;  Schuerch  et  al., 2018) vary greatly. Although all approaches have individual strengths and  weaknesses  (Törnqvist  et  al.,  2021),  paleorecords  provide  some clarity because they yield estimates of wetland responses to changes in climate in the absence of other anthropogenic drivers and are therefore inherently conservative. On the basis of paleorecords (Table 3.8), we assess  that  mangroves  and  salt  marshes  are  likely  at  high  risk  from future SLR, even under SSP1-1.9, with impacts manifesting in the mid-term  (medium  confidence).  Under  SSP5-8.5,  wetlands  are  very  likely at  high  risk  from  SLR,  with  larger  impacts  manifesting  before  2040 (medium  confidence).  By  2100,  these  ecosystems  are  at  high  risk  of impacts  under  all  scenarios  except  SSP1-1.9  (high  confidence),  with impacts most severe along coastlines with gently sloping shorelines, limited sediment inputs, small tidal ranges and limited space for inland migration (very high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Schuerch et al., 2018; FitzGerald and Hughes, 2019; Leo et al., 2019; Schuerch et al., 2019; Raw et al., 2020; Saintilan et al., 2020).For  seagrasses,  recent  projections  for  climate-change  impacts  vary by  species  and  region. Warming  is  projected  to  increase  the  habitat available to Zostera marina on the east coast of the USA by 2100 but contract  its  southern  range  edge  by  150–650 km  under  RCP2.6  and RCP8.5,  respectively  (Wilson  and  Lotze,  2019).  Other  species,  such as  Posidonia  oceanica  in  the  Mediterranean,  might  lose  as  much  as 75% of their habitat by 2050 under RCP8.5 and become functionally extinct  (low  confidence)  by  2100  (Chefaoui  et  al.,  2018).  Observed impacts of MHWs (Kendrick et al., 2019; Strydom et al., 2020; Serrano et al., 2021) indicate that increasing intensity and frequency of MHWs (Section 3.2.2.1) will have escalating impacts on seagrass ecosystems (high confidence). Habitat suitability can also be reduced by moderate RSLR,  due  to  its  impact  on  light  attenuation  (medium  confidence) (Aoki et al., 2020; Ondiviela et al., 2020; Scalpone et al., 2020).Overall, warming will drive range shifts in wetland species (medium to high confidence), but SLR poses the greatest risk for mangroves and salt marshes, with significant losses projected under all future scenarios by mid-century (medium confidence) and substantially greater losses 423Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.9 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of sandy beaches.ObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)‘Globally, beaches and dunes have in general undergone net erosion over the past century or longer.’‘Attributing shoreline changes to climate change is still difficult owing to the multiple natural and anthropogenic drivers contributing to coastal erosion.’‘In the absence of adaptation, beaches, sand dunes and cliffs currently eroding will continue to do so under increasing sea level (high confidence).’‘Coastal squeeze is expected to accelerate with a rising sea level. In many locations, finding sufficient sand to rebuild beaches and dunes artificially will become increasingly difficult and expensive as present supplies near project sites are depleted (high confidence).’‘In the absence of adaptation measures, beaches and sand dunes currently affected by erosion will continue to be affected under increasing sea levels (high confidence).’SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)3Coastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes and adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Attributing such impacts to SLR, however, remains challenging due to the influence of other climate-related and non-climate drivers such as infrastructure development and human-induced habitat degradation (high confidence). Coastal ecosystems, including salt marshes, mangroves, vegetated dunes and sandy beaches, can build vertically and expand laterally in response to SLR, though this capacity varies across sites (high confidence) as a consequence of human actions that fragment wetland habitats and restrict landward migration. Coastal ecosystems also progressively lose their ability to adapt to climate-induced changes and provide ecosystem services, including acting as protective barriers (high confidence).‘Loss of breeding substrate, including mostly coastal habitats such as sandy beaches, can reduce the available nesting or pupping habitat for land-breeding marine turtles, lizards, seabirds and pinnipeds (high confidence).’‘Overall, changes in sandy beach morphology have been observed from climate-related events, such as storm surges, intensified offshore winds and from coastal degradation caused by humans (high confidence), with impacts on beach habitats (e.g., benthic megafauna) (medium confidence).’‘Sandy beach ecosystems will increasingly be at risk of eroding, reducing the habitable area for dependent organisms (high confidence).’‘Sandy shorelines are expected to continue to reduce their area and change their topography due to SLR and increased extreme climatic erosive events. This will be especially important in low-lying coastal areas with high population and building densities (medium confidence).’‘Assuming that the physiological underpinning of the relationship between body size and temperature can be applied to warming (medium confidence), the body size of sandy beach crustaceans is expected to decrease under warming (low evidence, medium agreement).’Sandy beaches transition from undetectable to moderate risk between 0.9°C and 1.8°C (medium confidence) of global sea surface warming and from moderate to high risk at 2.3°C–3.0°C of global sea surface warming (medium confidence).‘Projected changes in mean and extreme sea levels and warming under RCP8.5 are expected to result in high risk of impacts on sandy beach ecosystems by the end of the 21st century (medium confidence), taking account of the slow recovery rate of sandy-beach vegetation, the direct loss of habitats and the high climatic sensitivity of some fauna.’‘Under RCP2.6, the risk of impacts on sandy beaches is expected to be only slightly higher than the present-day level (low confidence). However, pervasive coastal urbanisation lowers the buffering capacity and recovery potential of sandy beach ecosystems to impacts from SLR and warming, and thus is expected to limit their resilience to climate change (high confidence).’‘Coastal squeeze and human-driven habitat deterioration will reduce the natural capacity of these ecosystems to adapt to climate impacts (high confidence).’by 2100 under all scenarios except SSP1-1.9 (high confidence). MHWs pose  the  greatest  risk  to  seagrasses  (high  confidence).  In  all  cases, losses will be greatest where accommodation space is constrained or where other non-climate drivers exacerbate risk from climate-induced drivers (very high confidence).3.4.2.6 Sandy BeachesSandy  beaches  comprise  unvegetated,  fine-  to  medium-grained sediments  in  the  intertidal  zones  that  line  roughly  one-third  of  the length of the world’s ice-free coastlines (Luijendijk et al., 2018). The amenity  value  of  beaches  as  cultural,  recreational  and  residential destinations  has  driven  extensive  urbanisation  of  beach-associated coastlines (Todd et al., 2019). Beaches also provide habitat for many resident  species,  nesting  habitat  for  marine  vertebrates,  filtration of  coastal  waters  and  protection  of  the  coastline  from  erosion (McLachlan and Defeo, 2018). These soft-sediment coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss caused by erosion, especially where landward transgression is inhibited by infrastructure (Table 3.9).Since  SROCC,  observed  trends  in  coastal  erosion  continue  to  be obscured  by  beach  nourishment  that  replaces  eroded  sediment  or by  coastal  protection  of  areas  at  risk  of  erosion  (Section  3.6.3.1.1; Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3).  Nevertheless,  RSLR,  increases in  wave  energy  and/or  changes  in  wave  direction,  disruptions  to sediment  supplies  (including  sand  mining)  and  other  anthropogenic modifications of the coast have driven localised beach erosion (very high confidence) at rates up to 0.5–3 m yr–1 (Vitousek et al., 2017a; Vitousek  et  al.,  2017b;  Cambers  and  Wynne,  2019;  Enríquez-de-Salamanca,  2020;  Sharples  et  al.,  2020).  Corresponding  analyses of  coarse-scale  (30-m  resolution)  global  data  estimate  that  15%  of tidal  flats  (including  beaches)  have  been  lost  since  1984  (medium confidence)  (Mentaschi  et  al.,  2018;  Murray  et  al.,  2019)  but  with  a corresponding  number  of  the  world’s  beaches  accreting  (28%)  as eroding (24%) (medium confidence) (Luijendijk et al., 2018).Progress  is  being  made  towards  models  that  can  project  beach erosion  under  future  scenarios  despite  inherent  uncertainties  and the  presence  of  multiple  confounding  drivers  in  the  coastal  zone (Vitousek et al., 2017b; Le Cozannet et al., 2019; Cooper et al., 2020a; Vousdoukas et al., 2020b; Vousdoukas et al., 2020a). In the interim, models with varying levels of complexity estimate local loss of beach area to SLR by 2100 under RCP8.5-like scenarios, assuming minimal human  intervention,  ranging  30–70%  (low  confidence)  (Vitousek 424Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Relative trends in projected regional shoreline change (advance/retreat relative to 2010)(a) RCP4.5 2050(b) RCP4.5 2100(c) RCP8.5 2050(d) RCP8.5 2100 3Shoreline retreat (erosion)Shoreline advance (accretion)200m50m50m200mFigure 3.14 |  Relative trends in projected regional shoreline change (advance/retreat relative to 2010).

Projections account for both long-term shoreline dynamics and sea level rise and assume no impediment to inland transgression of sandy beaches. Data for small island states are aggregated and plotted in the Caribbean. (Data are from Vousdoukas et al., 2020b.) Values for reference regions established in the WGI AR6 Atlas (Gutiérrez et al., 2021) were computed as area-weighted means from original country-level data. (For model assumptions and associated debate, see Vousdoukas et al., 2020a and Cooper et al., 2020a.)et  al.,  2017b;  Mori  et  al.,  2018;  Ritphring  et  al.,  2018;  Hallin  et  al., 2019;  Kasmi  et  al.,  2020).  Within  regions,  projected  impacts  scale negatively  with  beach  width  and  positively  with  the  magnitude  of projected  SLR.  None  of  these  local  studies,  however,  considered high-energy  storm  events,  which  are  known  to  also  impact  sandy coasts  (high  confidence)  (e.g.,  Burvingt  et  al.,  2018;  Garrote  et  al., 2018; Duvat et al., 2019; Sharples et al., 2020), and model structure often had more influence on projected shoreline responses than did physical  drivers  (Le  Cozannet  et  al.,  2019).  Nevertheless,  the  most-advanced  available  models,  which  incorporate  multiple  coastal processes, including SLR, project that without anthropogenic barriers to erosion, 13.6–15.2% and 35.7–49.5% of the world’s beaches likely risk undergoing at least 100 m of shoreline retreat (relative to 2010) by 2050 and 2100, respectively (low confidence) (Vousdoukas et al., 2020b).  Aggregating  these  trends  regionally  suggests  that  relative rates of shoreline change under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 diverge strongly after  mid-century,  with  trends  towards  erosion  escalating  under RCP8.5 by 2100 (medium confidence) (Figure 3.14; Vousdoukas et al., 2020b). This trend supports the WGI AR6 assessment that projected SLR will contribute to erosion of sandy beaches, especially under high-emissions  futures  (high  confidence)  (WGI  AR6  Technical  Summary; Arias et al., 2021).For  beach  fauna,  emerging  evidence  links  range  shifts,  increasing representation by warm-affinity species and mass mortalities to ocean warming  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement)  (McLachlan  and  Defeo, 2018;  Martin  et  al.,  2019).  But  even  amongst  the  best-studied  taxa, such  as  turtles,  vulnerability  to  warming  (high  confidence)  and  SLR (medium  confidence)  anticipated  on  the  basis  of  theory  (Poloczanska et al., 2009; Saba et al., 2012; Pike, 2013; Laloë et al., 2017; Tilley et al., 2019) yields only a few detected impacts in the field associated mainly with  feminisation  (female-skewed  sex  ratios  driven  by  warmer  nest temperatures) (Jensen et al., 2018; Colman et al., 2019; Tilley et al., 2019), phenology (Monsinjon et al., 2019), reproductive success (Bladow and Milton, 2019) and inter-nesting period (Valverde-Cantillo et al., 2019). Moreover,  although  established  vulnerabilities  imply  high  projected future risk for turtles (high confidence) (e.g., Almpanidou et al., 2019; Monsinjon et al., 2019; Patrício et al., 2019; Varela et al., 2019; Santidrián Tomillo  et  al.,  2020),  many  populations  remain  resilient  to  change (Fuentes et al., 2019; Valverde-Cantillo et al., 2019; Laloë et al., 2020; 425Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesLamont et al., 2020), perhaps because variation in sand temperatures at nesting depth among beaches very likely exceeds the magnitude of warming anticipated by 2100, even under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Bentley et al., 2020a). As expected for a taxon with a long evolutionary history, turtles display natural adaptation, not only by virtue of broad geographic  distributions  that  include  natural  climate-change  refugia (Boissin et al., 2019; Jensen et al., 2019), but also because some initial responses  to  warming  might  counteract  anticipated  impacts.  For example,  although  feminisation  poses  a  significant  long-term  risk  to turtle populations (high confidence), it might contribute to population growth  in  the  near  to  mid-term  (medium  confidence)  (Patrício  et  al., 2019). Resilience to climate change might be further enhanced by range extensions,  alterations  in  nesting  phenology  and  fine-scale  nest-site selection (medium confidence) (Abella Perez et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2017; Almpanidou et al., 2018; Rivas et al., 2019; Laloë et al., 2020).New  literature  since  SROCC  on  climate  impacts  and  risks  has  been scarce for most beach taxa besides turtles. (The impacts of storms on beach fauna are variable and are described in SM3.3.1.) Nevertheless, theoretical  sensitivity  to  warming  (Section  3.3.2),  together  with  the projected  loss  of  habitat  under  future  climate  scenarios,  suggest substantial impacts for populations and communities of beach fauna into the future (high confidence). These impacts will be exacerbated by coastal  squeeze  along  urbanised  coastlines  (high  confidence),  albeit with magnitudes that cannot yet be accurately projected (McLachlan and Defeo, 2018; Le Cozannet et al., 2019; Leo et al., 2019).33.4.2.7 Semi-Enclosed SeasThis  section  assesses  impacts  on  five  SES,  or  seas  larger  than 200,000 km2 with single entrances &lt;120 km wide, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. These SES are largely landlocked and are thus heavily influenced Table 3.10 |  Summary of past IPCC assessments of semi-enclosed seas (SES)by  surrounding  landscapes,  local  and  global  climate-induced  drivers, as  well  as  non-climate  drivers  (Section  3.1),  making  them  highly vulnerable  to  cumulative  threats.  Key  climate-induced  drivers  in  SES are warming, increasing frequency and duration of MHWs, acidification and the increasing in size and number of OMZs (Figure 3.12; Hoegh-Guldberg  et  al.,  2014).  In  AR5,  SES  were  recognised  as  regionally significant for fisheries and tourism but highly exposed to both local and global stressors, offering limited options for organisms to migrate in response to climate change (Table 3.10).Since AR5, there is evidence for increasing frequency and duration of MHWs, extreme-weather events and a diversity of threats across depth strata causing mass-mortality events, local extirpations and coral reef decline (high confidence) (Section 3.4.2.1; SM3.3.2; Buchanan et al., 2016a; Shlesinger et al., 2018; Wabnitz et al., 2018b; Garrabou et al., 2019).  In  most  SES,  non-climate  drivers,  including  pollution,  habitat destruction  and  especially  overfishing,  are  decreasing  the  local adaptive capacity of organisms and the ability of ecosystems to cope with  climate-change  impacts  (high  confidence)  (Cramer  et  al.,  2018; Hidalgo  et  al.,  2018;  Ben-Hasan  and  Christensen,  2019). The  SLR  is accelerating faster than expected (high confidence) (Kulp and Strauss, 2019), posing a key risk to SES’ coastal ecosystems and the services they  provide  in  urban  areas,  including  drinking  water  provision, housing  and  recreational  activities,  among  others  (Hérivaux  et  al., 2018; Reimann et al., 2018).The size and number of OMZs are increasing worldwide and in most SES  (high  confidence)  (Global  Ocean  Oxygen  Network,  2018),  with growing impacts on fish species diversity and ecosystem functioning. In the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, increasing nutrient loads associated with coastal  activities  and  warming  has  increased  the  size  of  OMZs  (high confidence) (Al-Said et al., 2018; Lachkar et al., 2019). OMZs represent an  even  greater  problem  in  the  Black  and  Baltic  seas,  with  broad ObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014)‘The surface waters of the SES exhibit significant warming from 1982, and most CBS [coastal boundary systems] show significant warming since 1950. Warming of the Mediterranean has led to the recent spread of tropical species invading from the Atlantic and Indian oceans.’‘SES are highly vulnerable to changes in global temperature on account of their small [seawater] volume and landlocked nature. Consequently, SES will respond faster than most other parts of the ocean (high confidence).’‘The impact of rising temperatures on SES is exacerbated by their vulnerability to other human influences such as over-exploitation, pollution and enhanced runoff from modified coastlines. Due to a mixture of global and local human stressors, key fisheries have undergone fundamental changes in their abundance and distribution over the past 50 years (medium confidence).’‘Projected warming increases the risk of greater thermal stratification in some regions, which can lead to reduced O2 ventilation [of underlying waters] and the formation of additional hypoxic zones, especially in the Baltic and Black seas (medium confidence).’‘Changing rainfall intensity can exert a strong influence on the physical and chemical conditions within SES, and in some cases will combine with other climatic changes to transform these areas. These changes are likely to increase the risk of reduced bottom-water O2 levels to Baltic and Black Sea ecosystems (due to reduced solubility, increased stratification, and microbial respiration), which is very likely to affect fisheries.’Persian Gulf, Red Sea: ‘Extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, are projected to increase (high confidence) [... and] temperatures are very likely to increase above established thresholds for mass coral bleaching and mortality (very high confidence).’SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Semi-enclosed seas were not assessed in this report.426‘Projections from multiple fish species distribution models for multiple fish species show hotspots of decrease in species richness in the Indo-Pacific region, and semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf (medium evidence, high agreement).In addition, geographic barriers, such as land boundaries [...] or lower oxygen water in deeper waters, are projected to limit species range shifts in SES, resulting in a larger relative decrease in species richness (medium confidence).’Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3implications  for  ecosystem  function  and  services  (Levin  et  al.,  2009), especially  where  actions  to  reduce  nutrient  loading  from  land  have been unable to reduce the OMZ coverage (high confidence) (Carstensen et  al.,  2014;  Miladinova  et  al.,  2017;  Global  Ocean  Oxygen  Network, 2018).  In  the  Baltic  Sea,  OMZs  are  affecting  the  extent  of  suitable spawning  areas  of  cod,  Gadus  morhua  (high  confidence)  (Hinrichsen et al., 2016), while in the Black Sea, the combined effect of OMZs and warming is influencing the distribution and physiology of fish species, and  their  migration  and  schooling  behaviour  in  their  overwintering grounds (medium confidence) (Güraslan et al., 2017). Cascading effects on  food  webs  have  been  reported  in  the  Baltic,  where  detrimental effects of changing oxygen levels on zooplankton production, pelagic and  piscivorous  fish  are  influencing  seasonal  succession  and  species composition of phytoplankton (high confidence) (Viitasalo et al., 2015).In  the  Mediterranean  Sea  (Cross-Chapter  Paper  4),  the  increase  in climate  extremes  and  mass-mortality  events  reported  in  AR5  has continued (very high confidence) (Gómez-Gras et al., 2021). Extreme-weather  events  (including  deep  convection;  González-Alemán  et  al., 2019) and MHWs have become more frequent (Darmaraki et al., 2019) and  are  associated  with  mass  mortality  of  benthic  sessile  species across  the  basin  (high  confidence)  (Garrabou  et  al.,  2019;  Gómez-Gras et al., 2021). Since AR5, in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, extreme temperatures,  together  with  disease  and  predation,  have  continued to  cause  bleaching-induced  mortality  of  corals,  along  with  declines in the average coral-colony size (high confidence) (Burt et al., 2019). Poleward migration and tropicalisation of species (Section 3.4.2.3) has also continued in the Mediterranean, and these phenomena have also become  an  issue  in  the  Black  Sea  (high  confidence)  (Boltachev  and Karpova, 2014; Hidalgo et al., 2018). Climate impacts on phytoplankton production and phenology show high spatial heterogeneity across the Mediterranean Sea (medium evidence) (Marbà et al., 2015b; Salgado-Hernanz  et  al.,  2019),  with  consequent  effects  on  the  diversity  and abundance  of  zooplankton  and  fish  species  (medium  confidence) (Peristeraki et al., 2019). Changes in primary production and a decrease in  river  runoff  have  also  altered  the  optimum  habitats  for  small pelagic  fish  in  the  Mediterranean,  from  the  local  to  the  basin  scale (Piroddi et al., 2017). Evidence of impacts from ocean acidification is increasing, with the rates of coral calcification showing major decline in  the  Red  Sea  (medium  confidence)  (Section  3.4.2.1;  Steiner  et  al., 2018;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  In  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  evidence  of acidification  events  have  been  reported  at  the  local  scale  (Hassoun et  al.,  2015),  with  impacts  on  bivalves  and  coralligenous  species (medium confidence) (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2016).Climate  models  project  increasing  frequency  and  intensity  of  MHWs (high  confidence)  (Section  3.2.2.1),  which  will  exacerbate  warming-driven  impacts  in  the  Red  Sea  and  Persian  Gulf  regions,  and  erode the resilience of Red Sea coral reefs (high confidence) (Osman et al., 2018; Genevier et al., 2019; Kleinhaus et al., 2020). In the Persian Gulf region,  extreme  temperatures,  &gt;35°C  (Pal  and  Eltahir,  2016),  have been linked with high rates of extirpation and a decrease in fisheries catch  potential  (medium  confidence)  (Wabnitz  et  al.,  2018b).  In  the Mediterranean  Sea,  east–west  gradients  in  rates  of  warming  are projected to trigger spatially different changes in primary production, which combined with the increasing arrival of non-indigenous species, may trigger biogeographic changes in fish diversity, increasing in the eastern  and  decreasing  in  the  western  Mediterranean  (medium  to high confidence) (Albouy et al., 2013; Macias et al., 2015). Projections also  show  greater  impacts  from  SLR  than  originally  expected  in  the Mediterranean  and  Baltic  (e.g.,  Dieterich  et  al.,  2019;  Thiéblemont et al., 2019). In the Baltic Sea, under high nutrient load and warming climate scenarios, eutrophication is projected to increase in the future (2069–2098)  compared  with  historical  (1976–2005)  periods.  In contrast, under continued nutrient load reductions following present management  regulations,  environmental  conditions  and  ecological state will continue to improve independently of the climate-warming scenarios (low to medium confidence) (Saraiva et al., 2019).3.4.2.8 Shelf SeasShelf seas overlie the continental margin, often with maximum depths of &lt;200 m, and represent 7% of the global ocean by area (Simpson and  Sharples,  2012).  These  ecosystems  are  found  offshore  of  every continent, generate 10–30% (Mackenzie et al., 2000; Andersson and Mackenzie, 2004) of global marine net primary production and play a key role in global biogeochemical cycling, including the export of land-borne carbon and nutrients (Johnson et al., 1999; Nishioka et al., 2011; Li et al., 2019) to the deep ocean and recycling of fixed nitrogen back to the atmosphere via denitrification (Devol, 2015). The shelf seas are home to several of the world’s major industrial capture fisheries, such as those of the mid-Atlantic Bight, Scotian Shelf, Eastern Bering Sea Shelf and North Brazil Shelf (Barange et al., 2018), and support other marine industries, including aquaculture, extractive industries (oil, gas and mining), shipping and renewable energy installations.3Similar to other coastal ecosystems, evidence since SROCC (Table 3.11) suggests that shelf-sea ecosystems and the fisheries and aquaculture they support are sensitive to the interactive effects of climate-induced drivers,  as  well  as  non-climate  drivers,  including  nutrient  pollution, sedimentation,  fishing  pressure  and  resource  extraction  (Table  3.12; Figure  3.12).  Changes  in  freshwater,  nutrient  and  sediment  inputs from rivers due to both climate-induced and non-climate drivers can influence  productivity  and  nutrient  limitation,  ecosystem  structure, carbon  export  and  species  diversity  and  abundance  (Balch  et  al., 2012;  Picado  et  al.,  2014),  and  can  result  in  reduced  water  clarity and  light  penetration  (Dupont  and  Aksnes,  2013;  McGovern  et  al., 2019). Seasonal bottom-water hypoxia occurs in some shelf seas (e.g., northern  Gulf  of  Mexico,  Bohai  Sea,  East  China  Sea)  due  to  riverine inputs of freshwater and nutrients, promoting stratification, enhanced primary production and organic carbon export to bottom waters (high confidence) (Zhao et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2019; Del Giudice et al., 2020; Große  et  al.,  2020;  Jarvis  et  al.,  2020;  Rabalais  and  Baustian,  2020; Song et al., 2020a; Xiong et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a).Key risks to shelf seas include shifts or declines in marine micro- and macro-organism  abundance  and  diversity  driven  by  eutrophication, HABs and extreme events (storms and MHWs), and consequent effects on  fisheries,  resource  extraction,  transportation,  tourism  and  marine renewable energy (Figure 3.12). The combined effects of deoxygenation and  warming  can  affect  the  metabolism,  growth,  feeding  behaviour and mobility of fish species (Section 3.3.3). The increasing availability of  observations  mean  that  ecosystem  changes  in  shelf  seas  can  be increasingly  attributed  to  climate  change  (high  confidence)  (Liang 427Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.11 |  Summary of past IPCC assessments of shelf seasObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014)‘Primary productivity, biomass yields and fish capture rates have undergone large changes within the ECS [East China Sea] over the past decades (limited evidence, medium agreement, low confidence).’‘Changing sea temperatures have influenced the abundance of phytoplankton, benthic biomass, cephalopod fisheries and the size of demersal trawl catches in the northern SCS [South China Sea] observed over the period 1976–2004 (limited evidence, medium agreement).’‘Concurrent with the retreat of the ‘cold pool’ [...] on the northern Bering Sea shelf, [...] bottom trawl surveys of fish and invertebrates show a significant community-wide northward distributional shift and a colonisation of the former cold pool areas by sub-Arctic fauna (high confidence).’‘Observed changes in the phenology of plankton groups in the North Sea over the past 50 years are driven by climate forcing, in particular regional warming (high confidence).’‘Global warming will result in more frequent extreme events and greater associated risks to ocean ecosystems (high confidence). In some cases, [...] projected increases will eliminate ecosystems, and increase the risks and vulnerabilities to coastal livelihoods [and the vulnerabilities for food security including that of Southeast Asia] (medium to high confidence). Reducing stressors not related to climate change represents an opportunity to strengthen the ecological resilience within these regions, which may help them [biota] survive some projected changes in ocean temperature and chemistry.’Changes in eutrophication and hypoxia are likely to influence shelf seas, but there is low confidence in the understanding of the magnitude of potential changes and impacts on ecosystem functioning, fisheries and other industries.SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)‘Species composition of fisheries catches since the 1970s in many shelf seas ecosystems of the world is increasingly dominated by warm-water species (medium confidence).’‘Estuaries, shelf seas and a wide range of other intertidal and shallow-water habitats play an important role in the global carbon cycle through their primary production by rooted plants, seaweeds (macroalgae) and phytoplankton, and also by processing riverine organic carbon. However, the natural carbon dynamics of these systems have been greatly changed by human activities (high confidence).’3‘Direct anthropogenic impacts include coastal land-use change; indirect effects include increased nutrient delivery and other changes in river catchments, and marine resource exploitation in shelf seas. There is high confidence that these human-driven changes will continue, reflecting coastal settlement trends and global population growth.’et al., 2018; Maharaj et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Meyer and Kröncke, 2019;  Bargahi  et  al.,  2020;  Bedford  et  al.,  2020;  Friedland  et  al., 2020b;  Mérillet  et  al.,  2020).  Eutrophication  and  seasonal  bottom-water hypoxia in some shelf seas have been linked to warming (high confidence) (Wei et al., 2019; Del Giudice et al., 2020) and increased riverine nutrient loading (high confidence) (Wei et al., 2019; Del Giudice et al., 2020). Since SROCC, some severe HABs have been attributed to extreme  events,  such  as  MHWs  (Section  14.4.2;  Roberts  et  al.,  2019; Trainer et al., 2019); however, a recent worldwide assessment of HABs attributed  the  increase  in  observed  HABs  to  intensified  monitoring associated  with  increased  aquaculture  production  (high  confidence) (Hallegraeff et al., 2021).Since  SROCC,  changes  in  the  community  structure  and  diversity  of plankton, macrofauna and infauna have been detected in some shelf seas, although attribution has been regionally specific (e.g., bottom-water warming or hypoxia) (Meyer and Kröncke, 2019; Rabalais and Baustian, 2020). Detection of the picoplankton Synechococcus spp. in the North Sea is potentially linked to a summer decrease in copepod stocks  and  declining  food-web  efficiency  (low  confidence)  (Schmidt et al., 2020). The seasonally distinct phytoplankton assemblages in the North Sea have begun to appear concurrently and homogenise (Nohe et al., 2020). Changes in abundance, species composition and size of zooplankton have been detected in some shelf seas (Yellow Sea, North Sea, Celtic Sea and Tasman Sea), including a decline in stocks of larger copepods, increased abundances of gelatinous and meroplankton, and a shift to smaller species due to warming, increased river discharge, circulation  change  and/or  extreme  events  (high  confidence)  (Wang et al., 2018a; Bedford et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Edwards et al., 2021).Ocean  warming  has  shifted  distributions  of  fish  (Free  et  al.,  2019; Franco  et  al.,  2020;  Pinsky  et  al.,  2020b;  Fredston  et  al.,  2021)  and marine mammal species (Salvadeo et al., 2010; García-Aguilar et al., 2018; Davis et al., 2020) poleward (high confidence) or deeper (low to medium confidence) (Section 3.4.3.1; Nye et al., 2009; Pinsky et al., 2013; Pinsky et al., 2020b). Warming has also tropicalised the pelagic and  demersal  fish  assemblages  of  mid-  and  high-latitude  shelves (high  confidence)  (Montero-Serra  et  al.,  2015;  Liang  et  al.,  2018; Maharaj et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Friedland et al., 2020a; Kakehi et al., 2021; Punzón et al., 2021). Fisheries catch composition in many shelf-sea  ecosystems  has  become  increasingly  dominated  by  warm-water species since the 1970s (high confidence) (Cheung et al., 2013; Leitão et al., 2018; Maharaj et al., 2018; McLean et al., 2019). Warming has  taxonomically  diversified  fish  communities  along  a  latitudinal gradient  in  the  North  Sea  but  has  homogenised  functional  diversity (McLean  et  al.,  2019).  However,  in  some  regions,  changing  predator or  prey  distributions,  temperature-dependent  hypoxia,  population changes, evolutionary adaptation and other biotic or abiotic processes, including species’ exploitation, confound responses to climate-induced drivers, which must therefore be interpreted with caution (Frank et al., 2018). For example, although, most species’ range edges are tracking temperature  change  on  the  northeast  shelf  of  the  USA  (medium confidence)  (Fredston-Hermann  et  al.,  2020;  Fredston  et  al.,  2021), range edges of others are not.A  wide  range  of  responses  by  fish  and  invertebrate  populations to  warming  have  been  observed.  The  majority  of  responses  have been detrimental, with the direction and magnitude of the response depending on ecoregion, taxonomy, life history and exploitation history (Free et al., 2019; Yati et al., 2020).

(2019c); Hernvann and Gascuel (2020)Resource extractionContamination, change in benthic community structureHall (2002)has strongly decreased in the North Sea (Free et al., 2019), and fisheries yields  have  also  decreased  in  the  Celtic  Sea,  attributed  primarily  to warming  and  secondarily  to  long-term  exploitation  (Hernvann  and Gascuel, 2020; Mérillet et al., 2020). Conversely, fish species diversity and overall productivity have increased in the Gulf of Maine, even with warming (Le Bris et al., 2018; Friedland et al., 2020a; Friedland et al., 2020b). Fisheries yields have decreased in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea partially due to overexploitation (Ma et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019c), with warming exerting more influence on the yield of cold-water species than on temperate- and warm-water groups  (Ma  et  al.,  2019). The  combined  effects  of  exploitation  and multi-decadal  climate  fluctuations  make  it  difficult  to  assess  global climate-change impacts on fisheries yields (Chapter 5; Ma et al., 2019; Bentley et al., 2020b; Johnson et al., 2020).Since  AR5,  increasing  spatio-temporal  extent  of  hypoxia  has  been projected  due  to  enhanced  benthic  respiration  and  reduced  oxygen solubility  from  warming  (Del  Giudice  et  al.,  2020).  Similar  to  the open  ocean,  large  shifts  in  the  phenology  of  phytoplankton  blooms have  been  projected  for  shelf  seas  throughout  subpolar  and  polar waters (medium confidence) (Henson et al., 2018a; Asch et al., 2019). Zooplankton, which are important prey for many fish species and sea birds, are expected to decrease in abundance on the northeast shelf of  the  USA  (Grieve  et  al.,  2017);  however,  responses  vary  by  shelf ecosystem  (Chust  et  al.,  2014b).  Trends  towards  tropicalisation  will continue in the future (high confidence) (Cheung et al., 2015; Stortini et al., 2015; Allyn et al., 2020; Maltby et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2021), but uncertainty of future projections of fisheries production increases substantially  beyond  2040  (Maltby  et  al.,  2020).  Nevertheless,  shelf-sea fisheries at lower latitudes are most vulnerable to climate change (Monnereau  et  al.,  2017).  Under  future  climate  change  marked  by more  frequent  and  intense  extreme  events  and  the  influences  of multiple drivers, more flexible and adaptive management approaches could reduce climate impacts on species while also supporting industry adaptation (high confidence) (Section 3.6.3.1.2; Shackell et al., 2014; Stortini  et  al.,  2015;  Hare  et  al.,  2016;  Stortini  et  al.,  2017;  Greenan et al., 2019; Ocaña et al., 2019; Maltby et al., 2020).3.4.2.9  Upwelling Zones3Eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS) comprise four important social–ecological systems in the Pacific (California and Peru-Humboldt) and Atlantic (Canary and Benguela) ocean basins. Each is characterised by high primary production, sustained by wind-driven upwelling that draws cold, nutrient-rich, generally low-pH and low-oxygen water to the  surface  (Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  Despite  their  small  relative  size, the primary productivity in EBUS supports a vast biomass of marine consumers,  including  some  of  the  world’s  most  productive  fisheries (Pauly  and  Zeller,  2016),  along  with  many  species  of  conservation significance (Bakun et al., 2015).Although  upwelling  is  important  in  many  other  oceanic  regions,  we focus here on the most documented examples provided by the EBUS. Yet even here, observed changes in upwelling, temperature, acidification and  loss  of  oxygen  (Seabra  et  al.,  2019;  Abrahams  et  al.,  2021; Gallego et al., 2021; Varela et al., 2021) cannot be robustly attributed to  anthropogenic  climate  change,  and  projected  future  changes  in upwelling are expected to be relatively small and variable among and within EBUS (Section 3.2.2.3; WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). We therefore have few updates to assessments provided by AR5 and SROCC (Table 3.13) and restrict our brief assessment to the limited amount of new evidence (Figure 3.12).The California EBUS is arguably the best-studied of the four ecosystems in  terms  of  robust  projections  of  climate  change,  although  even  here, there  is  limited  evidence  and  low  agreement  among  projections.  For example, trends in outputs from high-resolution, downscaled models in the California EBUS generally reflect those from underlying coarser-scale ESMs, but projections for physical variables are more convergent among modelling approaches than are those for biogeochemical variables (high confidence) (Howard et al., 2020a; Pozo Buil et al., 2021). Models agree on general warming in the California EBUS, with concomitant declines in oxygen content (medium confidence) (Howard et al., 2020b; Fiechter et al., 2021; Pozo Buil et al., 2021). But implications for the future spatial distribution of species, including for some fisheries resources (Howard 429Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.13 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS)ObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Lluch-Cota et al., 2014)‘[EBUS] are vulnerable to changes that influence the intensity of currents, upwelling and mixing (and hence changes in sea surface temperature, wind strength and direction), as well as O2 content, carbonate chemistry, nutrient content and the supply of organic carbon to deep offshore locations (high confidence).’Climate-change-induced intensification of ocean upwelling in some EBUS, as observed in past decades, may lead to regional cooling, rather than warming, of surface waters and cause enhanced productivity (medium confidence), but also enhanced hypoxia, acidification and associated biomass reduction in fish and invertebrate stocks. Owing to contradictory observations, there is currently uncertainty about the future trends of major upwelling systems and how their drivers will shape ecosystem characteristics (low confidence).‘Declining O2 and shoaling of the aragonite saturation horizon through ocean acidification increase the risk of upwelling water being low in pH and O2, with impacts on coastal ecosystems and fisheries [...]. These risks and uncertainties are likely to involve significant challenges for fisheries and associated livelihoods along the west coasts of South America, Africa and North America (low to medium confidence).’‘There is robust evidence and medium agreement that the California Current has experienced [...] an increase of the overall magnitude of upwelling events from 1967 to 2010 (high confidence). This is consistent with changes expected under climate change yet remains complicated by the influence of decadal-scale variability (low confidence).’ Declining oxygen concentrations and shoaling of the hypoxic boundary layer likely ‘reduced the available habitat for key benthic communities as well as fish and other mobile species. Together with the shoaling of the saturation horizon, these changes have increased the incidence of low O2 and low pH water flowing onto the continental shelf (high confidence; 40 to 120 m), causing problems for industries such as the shellfish aquaculture industry.’Despite its apparent sensitivity to environmental variability, there is limited evidence of ecological changes in the Benguela Current EBUS due to climate change.3‘Like other ocean sub-regions, [EBUS] are projected to warm under climate change, with increased stratification and intensified winds as westerly winds shift poleward (likely). However, cooling has also been predicted for some [EBUS], resulting from the intensification of wind-driven upwelling.’‘There is medium agreement, despite limited evidence, that upwelling intensity and associated variables (e.g., temperature, nutrient and O2 concentrations) from the Benguela system will change as a result of climate change.’Any projected increase in upwelling intensity has potential disadvantages. ‘Elevated primary productivity may lead to decreasing trophic transfer efficiency, thus increasing the amount of organic carbon exported to the seabed, where it is virtually certain to increase microbial respiration and hence increase low O2 stress.’SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a; IPCC, 2019c; IPCC, 2019d)‘Increasing ocean acidification and oxygen loss are negatively impacting two of the four major upwelling systems: the California Current and Humboldt Current (high confidence). Ocean acidification and decrease in oxygen level in the California Current upwelling system have altered ecosystem structure, with direct negative impacts on biomass production and species composition (medium confidence).’‘Three out of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) have shown large-scale wind intensification in the past 60 years (high confidence). However, the interaction of coastal warming and local winds may have affected upwelling strength, with the direction of changes [varying] between and within EBUS (low confidence). Increasing trends in ocean acidification in the California Current EBUS and deoxygenation in California Current and Humboldt Current EBUS are observed in the last few decades (high confidence), although there is low confidence to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. The expanding California EBUS OMZ [oxygen minimum zone] has altered ecosystem structure and fisheries catches (medium confidence).’‘Overall, EBUS have been changing with intensification of winds that drives the upwelling, leading to changes in water temperature and other ocean biogeochemistry (medium confidence).’‘The direction and magnitude of observed changes vary among and within EBUS, with uncertainties regarding the driving mechanisms behind this variability. Moreover, the high natural variability of EBUS and their insufficient representation by global ESMs [Earth system models] gives low confidence that these observed changes can be attributed to anthropogenic causes.’‘Anthropogenic changes in EBUS will emerge primarily in the second half of the 21st century (medium confidence). EBUS will be impacted by climate change in different ways, with strong regional variability with consequences for fisheries, recreation and climate regulation (medium confidence). The Pacific EBUS are projected to have calcium carbonate undersaturation in surface waters within a few decades RCP8.5 (high confidence); combined with warming and decreasing oxygen levels, this will increase the impacts on shellfish larvae, benthic invertebrates, and demersal fishes (high confidence) and related fisheries and aquaculture (medium confidence).’‘The inherent natural variability of EBUS, together with uncertainties in present and future trends in the intensity and seasonality of upwelling, coastal warming and stratification, primary production and biogeochemistry of source waters poses large challenges in projecting the response of EBUS to climate change and to the adaptation of governance of biodiversity conservation and living marine resources in EBUS (high confidence).’‘Given the high sensitivity of the coupled human–natural EBUS to oceanographic changes, the future sustainable delivery of key ecosystem services from EBUS is at risk under climate change; those that are most at risk in the 21st century include fisheries (high confidence), aquaculture (medium confidence), coastal tourism (low confidence) and climate regulation (low confidence).’‘For vulnerable human communities with a strong dependence on EBUS services and low adaptive capacity, such as those along the Canary Current system, unmitigated climate-change effects on EBUS (complicated by other non-climatic stresses such as social unrest) have a high risk of altering their development pathways (high confidence).’et  al.,  2020b;  Fiechter  et  al.,  2021),  are  confounded  by  local-scale oceanographic processes (Siedlecki et al., 2021) and by lateral input of anthropogenic land-based nutrients (Kessouri et al., 2021), suggesting that such projections should be accorded low confidence.More generally, changes in upwelling intensity are observed to affect organismal  metabolism,  population  productivity  and  recruitment, and  food-web  structure  (medium  confidence)  (van  der  Sleen  et  al., 2018; Brodeur et al., 2019; Ramajo et al., 2020). But low confidence in projected trends in upwelling make it difficult to extrapolate these results  to  understand  potential  changes  in  the  ecology  of  EBUS. Projected changes in fish biomass within EBUS (Carozza et al., 2019) are  therefore  accorded  low  confidence.  Finally,  although  MHWs  are an  important  emerging  hazard  in  the  global  ocean,  with  intensity, 430Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3frequency  and  duration  increasing  strongly  (Section  3.2.2.1),  the number  of  MHW  days  yr–1  within  EBUS  has  been  increasing  more slowly (or decreasing faster, in the case of the Peru-Humboldt system) than in surrounding waters (Varela et al., 2021). Notwithstanding these trends, EBUS remain vulnerable both to MHWs (high confidence) (Sen Gupta et al., 2020) and to their long-lasting impacts (high confidence) (Arafeh-Dalmau  et  al.,  2019;  Harvell  et  al.,  2019;  McPherson  et  al., 2021). On this basis, the suggestion that EBUS may represent refugia from MHWs is accorded low confidence.Despite low confidence in detailed projections for ecological changes in  EBUS,  the  WGI  assessment  (WGI  AR6  Chapter  9;  Fox-Kemper et  al.,  2021)  that  upwelling-favourable  winds  will  weaken  (or  be present  for  shorter  durations)  at  low  latitude  but  intensify  at  high latitude (high confidence), albeit by no more than 20% in either case (medium  confidence),  presents  some  key  risks  to  associated  EBUS ecosystems.  These  risks  include  potential  decreases  in  provisioning services,  including  fisheries  and  marine  aquaculture  (Bertrand  et  al., 2018; Kifani et al., 2018; Lluch-Cota et al., 2018; van der Lingen and Hampton, 2018), and cultural services such as nature-based tourism (Section 3.5).3.4.2.10   Polar SeasThe polar seas cover ~20% of the global ocean and include the deep Arctic  Ocean  and  surrounding  shelf  seas  as  well  as  the  Southern Ocean south of the polar front. They play a significant role in ocean circulation  and  absorption  of  anthropogenic  CO2  (Meredith  et  al., 2019). The Arctic is characterised by polar seas surrounded by land, while  the  Antarctic  comprises  continental  Antarctica  surrounded by  the  Southern  Ocean.  These  high-latitude  ecosystems  share  key properties,  including  strong  seasonality  in  solar  radiation  and  sea ice coverage. Sea ice regulates water-column physics, chemistry and biology, air–sea exchange and is a critical habitat for many species. In  spring,  when  solar  radiation  returns  and  sea  ice  melts,  intense phytoplankton blooms fuel food webs that include rich communities of  both  resident  and  summer-migrant  species,  with  typically  high dependency on a few key species for trophic transfer (Meredith et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2020). Over the past two decades, Arctic Ocean surface  temperature  has  increased  in  line  with  the  global  average, while there has been no uniform warming across the Antarctic (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Thus, the rate of change due to warming, and associated sea ice loss, is greater in  the  Arctic  than  in  the  Antarctic  (high  confidence)  (Section  3.2; Table  3.14;  WGI  AR6  Chapter  9;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021).  Both Arctic  and Antarctic  regions  have  a  long  history  of  living  resource extraction,  including  some  of  the  largest  fisheries  on  the  globe  in terms of catches. However, only the Arctic hosts human populations, holding a rich Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (IKLK) on these  social–ecological  systems  (Cross-Chapter  Paper  6;  Meredith et al., 2019).Previous assessments of polar seas (Table 3.14) concluded that climate change  has  already  profoundly  influenced  polar  ecosystems,  through changing species distributions and abundances from primary producers to top predators, including both ecologically and economically important species (high confidence), and that it will continue to do so (Table 3.14).Since  SROCC,  evidence  demonstrates  that  warmer  oceans,  less  sea ice and increased advection results in increasing primary production in  the Arctic,  albeit  with  regional  variation  (high  confidence),  while trends remain spatially heterogeneous and less clear in the Antarctic (medium  confidence)  (Cross-Chapter  Paper  6;  Del  Castillo  et  al., 2019;  Lewis  et  al.,  2020;  Pinkerton  et  al.,  2021;  Song  et  al.,  2021a). Furthermore, climate warming influences key mechanisms determining energy  transfer  between  trophic  levels  including  (a)  altered  size spectra,  (b)  shifts  in  trophic  pathways,  (c)  phenological  mismatches and (d) increased top-down trophic regulation (Table 3.15); however, the scale of impacts from changes in these mechanisms on ecosystem productivity in warming polar oceans remains unresolved and is hence assigned low confidence.Major community shifts, both gradual and abrupt, are observed in polar oceans in response to warming trends and MHWs (Arctic only) (high confidence) (Figure 3.12; Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Beaugrand et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Huntington et al., 2020). In general, abundances and ranges of Arctic fish species are declining and contracting, while ranges of boreal fish species are expanding, both geographically and in terms of feeding interactions and ecological roles (high confidence) (Huserbråten et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Huntington et al., 2020; Pecuchet et al., 2020a), with variable outcomes for large commercial fish stocks (Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Kjesbu et al., 2014; Holsman et al., 2018; Free et al., 2019). The extreme seasonal solar radiation cycles of these high latitudes may both act as a barrier for species immigration and change predator–prey dynamics in previously ice-covered areas, factors  not  currently  considered  in  projections  (limited  evidence) (Kaartvedt and Titelman, 2018; Ljungström et al., 2021). Responses by marine mammals and birds to the ongoing changes in polar ecosystems are both positive and negative (Meredith et al., 2019; Bestley et al., 2020).  Phenological,  behavioural,  physiological  and  distributional changes  are  observed  in  marine  mammals  and  birds  in  response  to altered ecological interactions and habitat degradation, especially to loss  of  sea  ice  (high  confidence)  (see  Box  3.2;  Cross-Chapter  Paper 6;  Beltran  et  al.,  2019;  Cusset  et  al.,  2019;  Descamps  et  al.,  2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Huntington et al., 2020). Reproductive failures and  declining  abundances  attributed  to  warmer  polar  oceans  and less  sea  ice  cover  are  observed  in  populations  of  polar  bears,  Ursus maritimus,  seals,  whales  and  marine  birds  (high  confidence)  (see Box  3.2;  Duffy-Anderson  et  al.,  2019;  Ropert-Coudert  et  al.,  2019; Bestley et al., 2020; Chambault et al., 2020; Molnár et al., 2020; Stenson et al., 2020). The ongoing changes in polar marine ecosystems can lead to  temporary  increases  in  biodiversity  and  functional  diversity  (e.g., due to immigration of boreal species in the Arctic, high confidence), but  reduced  trophic-transfer  efficiencies  and  functional  redundancy, with uncertain consequences for ecosystem resilience and vulnerability (limited evidence, low agreement) (Griffith et al., 2019b; Alabia et al., 2020; du Pontavice et al., 2020; Alabia et al., 2021; Frainer et al., 2021).Calcareous  polar  organisms  are  among  the  groups  most  sensitive to  ocean  acidification  (high  confidence)  (Section  3.3.2).  Niemi  et  al. (2021) reports that &gt;80% of sampled sea snail, Limacina helicina, a key species in pelagic food webs, displayed signs of shell dissolution in the Amundsen  Gulf.  However,  bacteria,  phytoplankton,  zooplankton  and benthic communities are found to be detrimentally impacted, resilient or  even  positively  influenced  by  ocean  acidification  in  observational 3431Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.14 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments for polar seasObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)Poleward species distributional shifts are due to climate warming (medium to high confidence).Impacts of shifts in ocean conditions affect fish and shellfish abundances in the Arctic (high confidence).Changes in sea ice and the physical environment to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula are altering phytoplankton stocks and productivity, and krill (high confidence).SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a)‘A fundamental transformation is occurring in polar organisms and ecosystems, driven by climate change (high confidence).’3SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Some marine species will shift their ranges in response to changing ocean and sea ice conditions in the polar regions (medium confidence).Loss of sea ice in summer and increased ocean temperatures are expected to impact secondary pelagic production in some regions of the Arctic Ocean, with associated changes in the energy pathways within the marine ecosystem (medium confidence).Ocean acidification has the potential to inhibit embryo development and shell formation of some zooplankton and krill in the polar regions, with potentially far-reaching consequences to food webs in these regions (medium confidence).Shifts in the timing and magnitude of seasonal biomass production could disrupt coupled phenologies in the food webs, leading to decreased survival of dependent species (medium confidence).‘The losses in sea ice at 1.5°C and 2°C of warming will result in habitat losses for organisms such as seals, polar bears, whales and seabirds. There is high agreement and robust evidence that phytoplankton species will change because of sea ice retreat and related changes in temperature and radiation, and this is very likely to benefit fisheries productivity [in the Arctic spring bloom system].’‘‘Unique and threatened systems’ (RFC1), [including Arctic and coral reefs], display a transition from high to very high risk of transition at temperatures between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, as opposed to at 2.6°C of global warming in AR5 (high confidence).’Climate-induced changes in seasonal sea ice extent and thickness as well as ocean stratification are altering marine primary production (high confidence), with impacts on ecosystems (medium confidence).Changes in the timing, duration and magnitude of primary production have occurred in both polar oceans, with marked regional or local variability (high confidence).In both polar regions, climate-induced changes in ocean and sea ice conditions have expanded the range of temperate species and contracted the range of polar fish and ice-associated species (high confidence).Ocean acidification will affect several key Arctic species (medium confidence).Future climate-induced changes in the polar oceans, sea ice, snow and permafrost will drive habitat and biome shifts, with associated changes in the ranges and abundance of ecologically important species (medium confidence).Projected range expansion of sub-Arctic marine species will increase pressure for high-Arctic species (medium confidence), with regionally variable impacts.Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 uptake, causing corrosive conditions for calcium carbonate shell-producing organisms (high confidence), with associated impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium confidence).The projected effects of climate-induced stressors on polar marine ecosystems present risks for commercial and subsistence fisheries, with implications for regional economies, cultures and the global supply of fish, shellfish, and Antarctic krill (high confidence).Table 3.15 |  Examples of mechanisms influencing the transfer of energy between lower trophic levels in warmer polar oceansMechanismExamplesReferencesAltered size spectraShifts in trophic pathwaysShifts towards smaller algal cells and zooplankton in warmer and more stratified oceans results in longer and less-efficient food chains, with lower lipid content.Aarflot et al.

(2021)432Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3and experimental studies (Section 3.3; Hildebrandt et al., 2016; Thor et al., 2018; Ericson et al., 2019; McLaskey et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019;  Petrou  et  al.,  2019;  Renaud  et  al.,  2019;  Brown  et  al.,  2020; Hancock  et  al.,  2020;  Henley  et  al.,  2020;  Johnson  and  Hofmann, 2020;  Torstensson  et  al.,  2021).  While  fish  larval  stages  may  be sensitive, adult fish are expected to have low vulnerability to projected acidification  levels  (Section  3.3.3;  Hancock  et  al.,  2020),  although reduced  swimming  capacity  in  polar  cod  in  an  ocean  acidification experiment  has  been  observed  (Kunz  et  al.,  2018).  Polar  organisms’ sensitivity  to  ocean  acidification  may  increase  with  increasing  light levels due to the loss of sea ice (algae; Donahue et al., 2019; Kvernvik et  al.,  2020),  temperature  stress  (pteropods;  Johnson  and  Hofmann, 2020)  or  indirectly  via  increased  heterotrophic  bacterial  productivity (limited  evidence)  (Vaqué  et  al.,  2019).  Due  to  limited  mechanistic understanding of observed effects, and mixed responses among Arctic species,  future  impacts  of  ocean  acidification  are  assigned  medium confidence for polar species and low confidence for outcomes for polar ecosystems (Meredith et al., 2019; Green et al., 2021b).While levels of pollutants in biota (e.g., persistent organic pollutants, mercury)  have  generally  declined  over  the  past  decades,  recent increasing  levels  are  associated  with  release  from  reservoirs  in  ice, snow and permafrost, and through changing food webs and pathways for trophic amplification (medium confidence) (see Box 3.2; Ma et al., 2016; Amélineau et al., 2019; Foster et al., 2019; Bourque et al., 2020; Kobusińska et al., 2020). Also, a warmer climate, altered ocean currents and increased human activities elevate the risk of invasive species in the Arctic  (medium  confidence),  potentially  changing  ecosystems  in this region (high confidence) (Chan et al., 2019; Goldsmit et al., 2020). In the remote Antarctic, there is a lower risk of invasive species (limited evidence) (McCarthy et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2021).Fisheries are largely sustainably managed yet are expanding polewards following  sea  ice  melt  in  the  Arctic  (high  confidence)  (Fauchald et  al.,  2021)  and  possibly  in  the Antarctic  (limited  evidence)  (Santa Cruz et al., 2018). Tourism is increasing and expanding in both polar regions,  while  shipping  and  hydrocarbon  exploration  are  growing  in the  Arctic,  increasing  the  risks  of  compound  effects  on  vulnerable and  already  stressed  populations  and  ecosystems  (high  confidence) (Sections  3.6.3.1.3,  3.6.3.1.4;  Cross-Chapter  Paper  6;  Hauser  et  al., 2018;  Meredith  et  al.,  2019;  Helle  et  al.,  2020;  Rogers  et  al.,  2020; Cavanagh et al., 2021).Ensemble global model projections indicate future increases in primary production and total animal biomass towards 2100 under RCP2.6 (~5 and 50%, respectively) and RCP8.5 (~10 and 70%, respectively), in the Arctic  (Bryndum-Buchholz  et  al.,  2019;  Lotze  et  al.,  2019;  Nakamura and  Oka,  2019),  highlighting  opportunities  for,  and  possibly  conflicts over,  new  ecosystem  services  (Section  3.5).  For  the  Southern  Ocean, no overall trends are apparent, but greater variability in both primary production and total animal biomass are projected under RCP2.6, with an ~5 and 15% increase in primary production and total animal biomass under RCP8.5, respectively (Bryndum-Buchholz et al., 2019; Lotze et al., 2019;  Nakamura  and  Oka,  2019).  All  projections  presented  exhibit high  inter-model  variability  and  hence  uncertainty  (Heneghan  et  al., 2021).  Furthermore,  regional  models  project  significant  distributional shifts  and  wide-ranging  trends  (i.e.,  relatively  stable,  increasing  and declining)  in  productivity  for  key  ecological  and  commercial  species, and functional groups, with weak to strong dependence on emission scenarios,  indicating  low  confidence  in  future  outcomes  for  polar marine  ecosystems  and  associated  ecosystem  services  (Section  3.5; Piñones  and  Fedorov,  2016;  Griffiths  et  al.,  2017;  Klein  et  al.,  2018; Hansen et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2019; Tai et al., 2019;  Alabia  et  al.,  2020;  Holsman  et  al.,  2020;  Reum  et  al.,  2020; Veytia  et  al.,  2020;  Sandø  et  al.,  2021).  Potentially  highly  influential tipping points associated with Arctic sea ice melt and Antarctic ocean circulation  change  adds  to  this  uncertainty  (Cross-Chapter  Paper  6; Heinze  et  al.,  2021).  Nevertheless,  increasing  evidence  supports  that sustainable  and  adaptive  ecosystem-based  fisheries  practices  can reduce detrimental impacts of climate change on harvested populations (medium confidence) (Section 3.6.3.1.2; Klein et al., 2018; Free et al., 2019; Hansen et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020).3.4.3 Oceanic Systems and Cross-Cutting ChangesThe  oceanic  zone,  comprising  &gt;99%  of  the  ocean’s  volume,  is  highly exposed  to  climate-induced  drivers  because  of  its  proximity  to  the atmosphere (Section 3.2; Pörtner et al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019a), while its  relative  distance  from  human  settlements  and  coastal  ecosystems decreases variability and interactions, and permits many phenomena to be detected clearly and attributed to climate change. This section assesses how  climate-driven  changes  influence  oceanic  biological  systems  over very large spatial scales and notes how impacts on the epipelagic zone affect the mesopelagic, bathypelagic and deep seafloor ecosystems.33.4.3.1 Biogeography and Species Range Shifts3.4.3.1.1  Observed species range shiftsSince previous assessments (Table 3.16), poleward range shifts have remained a ubiquitous response to climate change (high confidence), moving species from warmer regions into higher-latitude ecosystems (Fossheim  et  al.,  2015;  Kumagai  et  al.,  2018;  Burrows  et  al.,  2019; Lenoir et al., 2020).Thermal  tolerances  of  epipelagic  populations  drive  biogeographic change  (Figures  3.10,  3.15),  but  the  strength  and  direction  of  range shifts tend to be modulated by both climate-induced and non-climate drivers (Pinsky et al., 2020b), including: (a) interactive effects of hypoxia and  ocean  acidification  (Sampaio  et  al.,  2021);  (b)  oceanic  dispersal barriers (Choo et al., 2021), food and critical habitat availability (Alabia et  al.,  2020; Tanaka  et  al.,  2021);  (c)  geographic  position,  including depth (Mardones et al., 2021); and (d) ocean currents (Sunday et al., 2015;  Chapman  et  al.,  2020;  Fuchs  et  al.,  2020).  The  difference between  physiological  thermal  tolerances  (Section  3.3.2)  and  local environmental  conditions  determines  safety  margins  against  future climate warming in ectotherms (Pinsky et al., 2019). Acclimation and evolution  (Section  3.3.4)  and  life-history  stage  (Section  3.3.3)  also alter species’ thermal tolerances. Biogeographic responses are further modulated by other interacting factors (Table 3.17).A  global  meta-analysis  of  range  shifts  (Lenoir  et  al.,  2020)  that included data from 951 species (over half of which exhibited median 433Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.16 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of biogeography and species range shiftsObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014)The distribution and abundance of many fishes and invertebrates have shifted poleward and/or to deeper, cooler waters (high confidence).On average, species’ distributions have shifted poleward by 72.0 ± 0.35 km per decade (high confidence).Spatial shifts of marine species due to projected warming will cause high-latitude invasions and high local-extinction rates in the tropics and semi-enclosed seas (medium confidence).SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)‘Ocean warming has contributed to observed changes in biogeography of organisms ranging from phytoplankton to marine mammals (high confidence).’‘The direction of the majority of the shifts of epipelagic organisms are consistent with a response to warming (high confidence)’ but are also shaped by oxygen concentrations and ocean currents across depth, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients (high confidence).Geographic ranges have shifted since the 1950s by 51.5 ± 33.3 km per decade (mean and very likely range) and 29.0 ± 15.5 km per decade for organisms in the epipelagic and seafloor ecosystems, respectively.‘Recent model projections since AR5 and SR15 continue to support global-scale range shifts of marine fishes at rates of tens to hundreds of km per decade in the 21st century, with rate of shifts being substantially higher under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6.’Schematic of range-shift dynamics in marine ectotherms in response to climate warming3Cool extremeWarm extremeDispersalPresent rangeFuture rangePopulationExtirpationColonisationRange expansionRange contractionFigure 3.15 |  Range-shift dynamics in marine ectotherms in response to climate warming. As the ocean warms, conditions at the edge of the species’ distribution may become warmer than the maximum thermal tolerance of the species (Figure 3.9), causing local populations to undergo a gradual decline in performance, a decreasing population size and ultimately their extirpation, resulting in a range contraction. Conversely, at the cool extreme of the distribution, habitats beyond the current range of the species will become thermally suitable in the future (i.e., within the species’ thermal tolerance range) and, providing the species can disperse to those locations, allow for the colonisation and consolidation of new populations and subsequent range expansion. These are processes conditioned by multiple drivers that interact with warming to ultimately define range-shift responses, some of which are described in Table 3.17. Note that physiological thermal tolerances relate to body temperatures of the organism rather than ambient temperatures.range  shifts  consistent  with  climate  change)  estimates  that  marine species  are  moving  poleward  at  a  rate  of  59.2 km  per  decade  (very likely  range:  43.7–74.7 km  per  decade),  closely  matching  the  local climate  velocity  (high  confidence).  In  some  cases,  warming-related distribution  shifts  were  followed  by  density-dependent  use  of  these areas,  influencing  associated  fisheries  (Baudron  et  al.,  2020),  and  in others,  warming  influenced  competitive  interactions:  in  the  Arctic-Boreal Barents Sea, warming-induced increases in cod (Gadus morhua) abundance reduces haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) abundance (Durant et al., 2020).Biogeographic shifts lead to novel communities and biotic interactions (high confidence) (Zarco-Perello et al., 2017; Pecuchet et al., 2020b), with  concomitant  changes  in  ecosystem  functioning  and  servicing (high confidence) (Vergés et al., 2019; Nagelkerken et al., 2020; Peleg et al., 2020). For instance, temperature-driven changes in distribution 434Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.17 |  Synthesis of selected processes conditioned by multiple environmental drivers that interact with warming to ultimately define range-shift responsesFactorEffectExample referencesEvolution and acclimationMarine heatwaves (MHWs)Ocean currentsClimatic refugiaOxygen availabilityHabitat availability and qualityBiotic interactions, including food availabilityEvolution of thermal tolerances and acclimation under local climatic conditions can increase resilience to future climate warming, slowing the loss of species at trailing (warm) range edges.MHWs can influence the evolution of thermal tolerances by eliminating genotypes that are intolerant of elevated temperatures.MHWs can produce widespread die-offs of shallow-water benthic organisms triggering extensive contractions of their ranges.Palumbi et al. (2014); Miller et al. (2020a)Buckley and Huey (2016); Sunday et al. (2019)Smale and Wernberg (2013)MHWs can facilitate range expansions by opening niches and/or enhancing recruitment of warm-affiliated species.Leriorato and Nakamura (2019); Thomsen et al. (2019); Monaco et al. (2021)Cold waves can halt or even reverse range expansions at leading edges.Leriorato and Nakamura (2019)Ocean currents can influence range dynamics through their effect on dispersal, depending on their magnitude, direction and seasonal patterns.Where currents align with spatial gradients of warming, range expansions track thermal changes more closely. Conversely, directional mismatches result in consistently slower expansion rates and larger response lags, an effect more acute for benthic organisms relying on passive dispersion of larvae and propagules.Rates of range contraction across taxa decreased (increased) under directional agreement (mismatch) with ocean currents, possibly associated with enhanced (reduced) flows of adaptive genes to warming in downstream (upstream) populations within the distributional range.Areas of locally stable climatic conditions, such as deeper waters or regions with internal tides or localised upwelling, can buffer the effects of regional warming, facilitating species persistence and conserving genetic diversity at rear-edge populations.Distributional shifts into deeper, cooler habitats can offer an effective alternative response to latitudinal shifts, because sharper thermal gradients mean that vertical displacements, needed to compensate for the same amount of warming, are several orders of magnitude smaller than planar displacements.Oxygen supersaturation may extend ectotherm survival to extreme temperatures and increase thermal tolerances by compensating for the increasing metabolic demand at high temperatures.Oxygen deprivation increases metabolic demand and respiration rates. Shallowing of oxygen-dead zones and subsequent hypoxic avoidance can render deep thermal refuges unsuitable for organisms.The availability and quality of habitat (underwater light conditions, adequate substrate, nutrient and food supply) set limits to the distribution of organisms and range-shift dynamics (e.g., resilience of populations to climate warming and the consolidation of range expansions).Species interactions can confer resilience to warming by retarding habitat degradation and buffering the impacts of warming on organisms.Changes in biotic interactions (e.g., altered predation rates, food availability, competition or trophic mismatches) induced by climate warming can modify range-shift dynamics.Hunt et al.

Prior  studies  suggested  range  shifts  to  depth  (Dulvy et al., 2008; Pinsky et al., 2013; Yemane et al., 2014), but increasing evidence suggests that fish and planktonic communities across large parts  of  the  North  Atlantic,  sub-Arctic  and  northeast  Pacific  Ocean redistribute horizontally with horizontal climate velocity, except where vertical  temperature  gradients  are  particularly  steep.  There  is  low confidence for temperature-driven depth shifts in the epipelagic zone (Burrows et al., 2019; Campana et al., 2020; Caves and Johnsen, 2021). At the same time, decreasing oxygen concentrations and the vertical expansion of OMZs have already decreased suitable habitat of pelagic fishes, including tuna and billfishes, by ~15% primarily due to vertical compression of environmental niches (Stramma et al., 2012; Deutsch et al., 2015).3.4.3.1.3  Projected changes in species range shiftsContinued changes in the biogeography of marine predators and prey are anticipated under future climate change, with climate velocity in the epipelagic zone during 2050–2100 under RCP8.5 projected to be sevenfold  faster  than  that  during  1955–2005  (medium  confidence) (Figure 3.4; Brito-Morales et al., 2020). This has substantial ecological implications,  as  projections  suggest  near  elimination  of  overlaps between  the  distributions  of  certain  predator–prey  pairs  in  the northeast Atlantic Ocean when their current joint distributions (1989–2014) are compared with those projected (2037–2062) under RCP8.5 (Sadykova et al., 2020).Deepening  of  epipelagic  isotherms  is  projected  to  accelerate  over 2006–2100  to  rates  of  8.5 m  per  decade  under  RCP4.5  and  32 m per  decade  under  RCP8.5  (Jorda  et  al.,  2020).  Although  vertical redistribution of thermal niches is three to four orders of magnitude slower than horizontal displacement, maximum depth limits imposed by  the  seafloor  and  photic  layer  (both  of  which  are  projected  to  be reached in this century) will likely vertically compress suitable habitat for most marine organisms (medium confidence) (Dueri et al., 2014; Jorda et al., 2020).Projections  from  coupled  biogeochemical  and  ecosystem  models suggest a general decline in mesopelagic biomass (Lefort et al., 2015), although  this  may  vary  among  ocean  basins.  The  volume  of  OMZs have  been  expanding  at  many  locations  (high  confidence),  and  the oxygen  content  of  the  subsurface  ocean  is  projected  to  decline  to historically unprecedented conditions over the 21st century (medium confidence) (Section 3.2.3.2; WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021)  at  a  rate  of  10–15 µM  per  decade  in  OMZs  (Section  3.2.3.2; Breitburg  et  al.,  2018).  Oxygen  availability  and  the  effects  of  ocean acidification  (Sections  3.3,  3.4.2)  on  zooplankton  might  become  a dominant  constraint  in  the  upper  ocean’s  metabolic  index,  which  is projected to decrease globally by 20% by 2100 (Deutsch et al., 2015; Steinberg and Landry, 2017). In addition, extremely rapid acceleration of climate velocities projected in the mesopelagic under all emissions scenarios  suggest  that  species  in  this  ocean  stratum  will  be  even more  exposed  to  future  warming  than  species  in  the  epipelagic (Figure  3.4;  Brito-Morales  et  al.,  2020).  But  projections  also  suggest that  warming-related  increases  in  trophic  efficiency  lead  to  a  17% increase  in  the  biomass  of  the  deep-scattering  layer  (zooplankton and fish in the mesopelagic) by 2100 (low confidence) (Bindoff et al., 2019a). Observational studies appear to show that mesopelagic fishes adapted to warm water increased in abundance and distribution in the California Current associated with warming and the expansion of OMZ (Koslow  et  al.,  2019),  suggesting  that  some  mesopelagic  fish  stocks might be resilient to a changing climate (medium confidence).3.4.3.2 Phenological Shifts and Trophic Mismatches3.4.3.2.1   Observed changesSROCC reported high confidence in phenological shifts towards earlier onset of biological events (Table 3.18), with phenological shifts among epipelagic species attributed to ocean warming (high confidence).Since SROCC, field data have continued to show that the phenology of  biological  events  in  the  ocean  is  very  likely  (high  to  very  high confidence)  advancing  in  response  to  climate  change,  with  71.9% of  published  observations  consistent  with  these  anticipated  effects (Figure 3.16a,b; Table 3.19), although most reports (95.6%) were from the  Northern  Hemisphere  (Figure  3.16a).  Biological  events  that  are shifting earlier in response to climate change include phytoplankton blooms  (Scharfe  and  Wiltshire,  2019;  Chivers  et  al.,  2020)  such  as: (a)  those  of  HAB  species  (Forsblom  et  al.,  2019;  Bucci  et  al.,  2020); (b) peaks in zooplankton abundance (Chevillot et al., 2017; Forsblom et al., 2019); (c) the migration (Otero et al., 2014; Kovach et al., 2015; Chust et al., 2019) and spawning of commercial fish (McQueen and Marshall,  2017;  Kanamori  et  al.,  2019),  including  crabs  and  squid (Henderson et al., 2017); and (d) breeding of marine reptiles (Mazaris et al., 2008; Cherkiss et al., 2020). Moreover, different trophic levels within  epipelagic  food  webs  are  responding  at  different  rates  (very high  confidence)  (Table  3.19;  Figure  3.16b,c),  with  greater  and more  consistent  responses  by  lower  trophic  levels  (phytoplankton, holozooplankton  and  meroplankton)  but  less  consistent,  weaker and  more  varied  responses  by  higher  trophic  levels. There  were  too few  independent  time  series  to  make  robust  estimates  for  benthic invertebrates,  plants,  marine  reptiles  and  mammals. This  differential response  across  trophic  levels  could  lead  to  trophic  mismatches (Neuheimer  et  al.,  2018),  where  predators  and  their  prey  respond asynchronously  to  climate  change  (Edwards  and  Richardson,  2004; Rogers  and  Dougherty,  2019;  Rubenstein  et  al.,  2019;  Émond  et  al., including 2020),  with  potential  population-level  consequences, declines in fish recruitment (Burthe et al., 2012; Chevillot et al., 2017; McQueen and Marshall, 2017; Asch et al., 2019; Durant et al., 2019; Régnier  et  al.,  2019). Available  evidence  also  suggests  that  feeding relationships  could  modulate  species  responses  to  climate  change, 436Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.18 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of phenological shifts and trophic mismatchesObservationsProjectionsAR5 WGII (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Larsen et al., 2014)‘Changes to sea temperature have altered the phenology, or timing of key life-history events such as plankton blooms, and migratory patterns, and spawning in fish and invertebrates, over recent decades (medium confidence). There is medium to high agreement that these changes pose significant uncertainties and risks to fisheries, aquaculture and other coastal activities.’The highly productive high-latitude spring bloom systems in the northeast Atlantic are responding to warming (medium evidence, high agreement), with the greatest changes being observed since the late 1970s in the phenology, distribution and abundance of plankton assemblages, and the reorganisation of fish assemblages, with a range of consequences for fisheries (high confidence).‘Observed changes in the phenology of plankton groups in the North Sea over the past 50 years are driven by climate forcing, in particular regional warming (high confidence).’‘On average, spring events in the ocean have advanced by 4.4 ± 0.7 days per decade (mean ± SE).’‘Shifts in the timing and magnitude of seasonal biomass production could disrupt matched phenologies in the food webs, leading to decreased survival of dependent species (medium confidence). If the timing of primary and secondary production is no longer matched to the timing of spawning or egg release, survival could be impacted, with cascading implications to higher trophic levels. This impact would be exacerbated if shifts in timing occur rapidly (medium confidence).’‘There is medium to high confidence that climate-induced disruptions in the synchrony between timing of spawning and hatching of some fish and shellfish and the seasonal increases in prey availability can result in increased larval or juvenile mortality or changes in the condition factor of fish and shellfish species in the Arctic marine ecosystems.’Projections of phenological shifts and trophic mismatches were not assessed in this report.SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)‘Phenology of marine ectotherms in the epipelagic systems related to ocean warming (high confidence) and the timing of biological events has shifted earlier (high confidence).’‘Timing of spring phenology of marine organisms is shifting to earlier in the year under warming, at an average rate of 4.4 ± 1.1 days per decade, although it is variable among taxonomic groups and among ocean regions.’Projections of phenological shifts and trophic mismatches were not assessed in this report.3WGI AR6 Chapter 2 (Gulev et al., 2021)‘Phenological metrics for many species of marine organisms have changed in the last half century (high confidence), though many regions and many species of marine organisms remain under-sampled or even unsampled. The changes vary with location and with species (high confidence). There is a strong dependence of survival in higher trophic-level organisms (fish, exploited invertebrates, birds) on the availability of food at various stages in their life cycle, which in turn depends on the phenologies of both (high confidence). There is a gap in our understanding of how the varied responses of marine organisms to climate change, from a phenological perspective, might threaten the stability and integrity of entire ecosystems.’Projections of phenological shifts and trophic mismatches were not assessed in this report.as  seen  in  breeding  of  surface-feeding  and  deeper-diving  seabirds (Descamps et al., 2019). These differential responses could determine ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ under future climate change (Lindén, 2018).3.4.3.2.2  Projected changesThe  CMIP6  ESM  ensembles  project  that,  by  2100,  18.8  ±  19.0% (mean  ±  very  likely  range)  and  38.9  ±  9.4%  of  the  ocean  surface will very likely undergo a change of 20 d or more (advance or delay) in the start of the phytoplankton growth period under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5,  respectively  (Figure  3.17a,b)  (low  confidence  due  to  the dependence  with  the  projected  changes  in  phytoplankton  biomass, the trends of which are reported with low confidence) (Section 3.4.3.4; SROCC  Section  5.2.3;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  Phytoplankton  growth is  projected  to  begin  later  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  subtropics, and  earlier  at  high  latitudes  in  some  regions  around  the  Antarctic Peninsula, and over large areas in the Northern Hemisphere (low to medium confidence as there are improved constraints from historical variability  in  this  region  and  consistency  with  CMIP5-based-studies results)  (Henson  et  al.,  2018b;  Asch  et  al.,  2019).  There  is  high agreement  in  model  projections  that  the  start  of  the  phytoplankton growth  period  will  very  likely  advance  in  the Arctic  Ocean  under  a high-emission  scenario  for  CMIP5  and CMIP6  (Figure 3.17b; Henson et al., 2018b; Asch et al., 2019; Tedesco et al., 2019; Lannuzel et al., 2020). The CMIP6 ensemble projections further show limited changes in  phenology  across  most  of  the  Southern  Ocean  but  large  regional variations  in  the  tropics  (Figure  3.17).  Overall,  the  regional  patterns are qualitatively similar under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 but with greater magnitude and larger areas under SSP5-8.5 (low confidence).At latitudes &gt;40°N, temperature-linked phenology of fish reproduction with high geographic fidelity to spawning grounds (geographic spawners) is  projected  to  change  at  double  the  rate  of  that  for  phytoplankton, which will likely cause phenological mismatches resulting in increased risk  of  starvation  for  fish  larvae  (medium  to  high  confidence)  (WGI AR6 Section 2.3.4.2.3; Asch et al., 2019; Durant et al., 2019; Régnier et al., 2019; Gulev et al., 2021; Laurel et al., 2021). Furthermore, under RCP8.5, trophic mismatch events exceeding ±30 days (Asch et al., 2019) leading to fish-recruitment failure are expected to increase tenfold for geographic spawners across much of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Arctic Ocean basins (low confidence) (Neuheimer et al., 2018).

Nevertheless, this compensation mechanism might fail at locations where phytoplankton bloom phenology is not controlled by temperature-driven water-column stratification,  leading  to  a  possible  sixfold  local  increase  in  extreme mismatches under climate change (Asch et al., 2019).3.4.3.3 Changes in Community Composition and Biodiversity3.4.3.3.1  Evidence of natural adaptive capacity based on species’ responses to past climate variabilityis Responses  to  abrupt  climate  change  in  the  geological  past  suggest that  adaptive  capacity limited  for  marine  animals  (Cross-Chapter  Box  PALEO  in  Chapter  1).  Temperatures  during  the  last Interglacial (~125 ka), which were warmer than today, led to poleward range shifts of reef corals (medium confidence) (Kiessling et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2019a). Temperature has also driven marine range shifts over multi-million-year time scales (medium confidence) (Gibbs et al., 2016;  Reddin et al., 2018). Warming climates, even  with low ocean-warming  rates,  inevitably  decreased  tropical  marine  biodiversity compared  with  middle  latitudes  (high  confidence)  (Mannion  et  al., 2014; Crame, 2020; Yasuhara et al., 2020; Raja and Kiessling, 2021).The paleorecord confirms that marine biodiversity has been vulnerable to climate warming both globally and regionally (very high confidence) (Cross-Chapter  Box  PALEO  in  Chapter  1;  Stanley,  2016).  In  extreme cases  of  warming  (e.g.,  &gt;5.2°C),  marine  mass  extinctions  occurred in  the  geological  past,  and  there  may  be  a  relationship  between warming  magnitude  and  extinction  toll  (medium  confidence)  (Song et al., 2021b). A combination of warming and spreading anoxia caused marine extinctions in ancient episodes of rapid climate warming (high confidence) (Bond and Grasby, 2017; Benton, 2018; Penn et al., 2018; Them II et al., 2018; Chen and Xu, 2019). The role of ocean acidification in ancient extinctions is yet to be resolved (low confidence) (Clapham and  Payne,  2011;  Clarkson  et  al.,  2015;  Jurikova  et  al.,  2020;  Müller et al., 2020).3.4.3.3.2  Observed and projected changes in contemporary community structure and biodiversityOcean  temperature  is  a  major  driver  of  species  richness  in  the global  ocean  at  evolutionary  time  scales  (Tittensor  et  al.,  2010; Chaudhary et al., 2021). This, together with temperature-driven range and  phenology  shifts  evident  across  taxa  and  ocean  ecosystems (Sections  3.4.3.1,  3.4.3.2),  suggests  that  recent  ocean  warming (Section 3.2.2.1) should alter biodiversity at regional to global scales. Since previous assessments (Table 3.20), the most common evidence supporting  these  expected  changes  is  replacement  of  cold-adapted species by warm-adapted species within an ecosystem as waters warm (Worm and Lotze, 2021). Known as tropicalisation (Section 3.4.2.3), this phenomenon has been attributed to ocean warming (medium to high confidence) in communities as diverse as kelp, invertebrates, plankton and fish (Burrows et al., 2019; Flanagan et al., 2019; Ajani et al., 2020; Villarino et al., 2020; Punzón et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2021).

Rate of consistency of responses with climate change is not significantly different from random chance.Just a single study for seagrasses, and only for consistency (Diaz-Almela et al., 2007).Includes earlier appearance of migratory fish in estuaries (e.g., Chevillot et al., 2017), earlier spawning migrations for anadromous fish such as salmon (e.g., Rubenstein et al., 2019), earlier migrations for sole (e.g., Fincham et al., 2013) and tuna (e.g., Dufour et al., 2010), and earlier spawning of key commercial demersal (bottom-dwelling) species such as cod (e.g., McQueen and Marshall, 2017).Evidence is limited, uncertainty levels are high. Mean phenological shift is not significantly different from zero.Neither the rate of consistency with climate change nor the phenological shift differ significantly from null expectations (50% consistency and no shift). Many seabirds are breeding earlier (Byrd et al., 2008; Sydeman et al., 2009), while breeding among others in temperate and polar regions has been delayed, which has been linked to later sea ice breakup or limited prey resources (Barbraud and Weimerskirch, 2006; Wanless et al., 2009; Chambers et al., 2014). Although the response of lifecycle events for many seabird species is variable in direction, there has usually been a more complex driver associated with climate that has been considered to be responsible (Sydeman et al., 2015). For many species, seasonal timing is moving earlier, especially in the Arctic (e.g., Byrd et al., 2008; Descamps et al., 2019), but for many species in the Southern Ocean, it is not (Barbraud and Weimerskirch, 2006; Chambers et al., 2014). This could be because of a much slower rate of warming in most of the Southern Ocean than in the Arctic.All studies of phenological changes for marine mammals have focused on whales (e.g., Ramp et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2017; Loseto et al., 2018) or polar bears (e.g., Cherry et al., 2013; Atwood et al., 2016; Escajeda et al., 2018) and have related timing to aspects of sea ice dynamics, highlighting the complexity of such processes. Mean phenological shift is not significantly different from zero at the global scale.439Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesProjected phytoplankton phenology(a) SSP1-2.6(b) SSP1-2.6ytisneD14121086420(c) SSP5-8.5(d) SSP5-8.53-40-30-200-10ΔTiming of initiation (days)10ytisneD14121086420203040-60-40-20ΔTiming of initiation (days)2004060Figure 3.17 |  Projected phytoplankton phenology.

Difference in the start of the phytoplankton growth period is calculated as 2090–2099 minus 1996–2013. Negative (positive) values indicate earlier (later) start of the phytoplankton growth period by 2100. The ensemble projections of global changes in phytoplankton phenology include, under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, a total of five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 Earth system models containing coupled ocean biogeochemical models that cover a wide range of complexity (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). (The phenology calculations are based on Racault et al., 2017, using updated data.)At  local  to  regional  scales,  tropicalisation  often  increases  species richness where warm-water species extend their ranges to overlap with existing  communities  and  decreases  species  richness  where  warming waters extirpate species (medium to high confidence) (Friedland et al., 2020a;  Chaudhary  et  al.,  2021;  Worm  and  Lotze,  2021).  Latitudinal estimates from catalogued observations show declining species richness in equatorial waters over the past 50 years, with concomitant increases in species richness at mid-latitudes; the pattern is especially prominent in free-swimming pelagic species (Figure 3.18; Chaudhary et al., 2021). Similar patterns among marine animals have been described previously for  historical  warming  events  (Song  et  al.,  2020b).  Tropicalisation  is associated with increased representation of herbivorous species (Vergés et  al.,  2016;  Zarco-Perello  et  al.,  2020;  Smith  et  al.,  2021),  although observations and theory suggest that dietary generalism can also favour range-shifting species (Monaco et al., 2020; Wallingford et al., 2020).At the community level, the magnitude and shape of projected future biodiversity changes differ depending on which groups are considered (medium confidence) (Chaudhary et al., 2021). Molecular-based richness measures indicate that the most dramatic increases in diversity relative to  current  conditions  are  expected  for  photosynthetic  eukaryotes and  copepods  in  the  Arctic  Ocean  (Ibarbalz  et  al.,  2019).  However, component eukaryotic taxa, for example diatoms (Busseni et al., 2020), are projected to lose diversity by 2100 under RCP8.5. Ecosystem models project  a  decline  in  nutrient  supply  that  drives  the  disappearance  of less-competitive and larger phytoplankton types, leading to extinction of up to 30% of diatom types, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, by  2100  under RCP8.5  (Henson  et al.,  2021). Models  further suggest that high latitudes are likely to encounter entirely novel phytoplankton communities  by  2100  under  RCP8.5  (100%  change  in  community composition; Dutkiewicz et al., 2019; Reygondeau et al., 2020). At the polar edges, the increased richness is projected to coincide with high species turnover and increasing dominance of smaller phytoplankton types  (Henson  et  al.,  2021).  These  imply  pronounced  changes  to both  the  oceans’  ecological  and  biogeochemical  function,  as  regions dominated  by  small  phytoplankton  typically  support  less-productive food webs (Section 3.4.3.4; Stock et al., 2017; Armengol et al., 2019) and sequester less particulate organic carbon (POC) in the deep ocean 440Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.20 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of community composition and biodiversityObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014)The paleoecological record shows that global climate changes comparable in magnitudes to those projected for the 21st century under all scenarios resulted in large-scale biome shifts and changes in community composition, and that for rates projected under RCP6 and 8.5 those changes were associated with species extinctions in some groups (high confidence).Loss of corals due to bleaching has a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of marine biodiversity in the tropics (high confidence).Spatial shifts of marine species due to projected warming will cause high-latitude invasions and high local-extinction rates in the tropics and semi-enclosed seas (medium confidence).Species richness and fisheries catch potential are projected to increase, on average, at mid and high latitudes (high confidence) and decrease at tropical latitudes (medium confidence).‘Shifts in the geographical distributions of marine species [...] cause changes in community composition and interactions [...]. Thereby, climate change will reassemble communities and affect biodiversity, with differences over time and between biomes and latitudes (high confidence).’‘Models are currently useful for developing scenarios of directional changes in net primary productivity, species distributions, community structure, and trophic dynamics of marine ecosystems, as well as their implications for ecosystem goods and services under climate change. However, specific quantitative projections by these models remain imprecise (low confidence).’SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)‘Ocean warming has contributed to observed changes in biogeography of organisms ranging from phytoplankton to marine mammals (high confidence), consequently changing community composition (high confidence), and in some cases altering interactions between organisms and ecosystem function (medium confidence).’Poleward range shifts are projected to decrease species richness in tropical oceans, counterbalanced by increases in mid- to high-latitude regions, leading to global-scale species turnover (medium confidence on trends, low confidence on magnitude because of model uncertainties and the limited number of published model simulations). ‘The projected intensity of species turnover is lower under low-emission scenarios (high confidence).’‘Projections from multiple fish species distribution models show hotspots of decrease in species richness in the Indo-Pacific region, and semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf (medium evidence, high agreement). In addition, geographic barriers, such as land, [bounding the] poleward species range edge in semi-enclosed seas or low-oxygen water in deeper waters are projected to limit range shifts, resulting in a larger relative decrease in species richness (medium confidence).’‘The large variation in sensitivity between different zooplankton taxa to future conditions of warming and ocean acidification suggests elevated risk on community structure and inter-specific interactions of zooplankton in the 21st century (medium confidence).’3(Section  3.4.3.5;  Mouw  et  al.,  2016;  Cram  et  al.,  2018)  than  areas dominated by larger size classes (high confidence).The  profound  climatic  and  environmental  changes  projected  for  the Arctic region by 2100 (Cross-Chapter Paper 6) are also anticipated to alter the composition of apex assemblages like marine mammals (see Box  3.2; Albouy  et  al.,  2020).  Under  both  RCP2.6  and  8.5  scenarios the most vulnerable marine mammal species will be the North Pacific right  whale  (Eubalaena  japonica,  listed  as  an  endangered  species; IUCN,  2020)  and  the  grey  whale  (Eschrichtius  robustus,  which  has critically  endangered  subpopulations;  IUCN,  2020). The  extinction  of the most-vulnerable species will disproportionately eliminate unique and  important  evolutionary  lineages  as  well  as  functional  diversity, with  consequent  impacts  throughout  the  entire  marine  ecosystem (Section  3.3.4).    More  generally,  future  warming  and  acidification simulated in  mesocosm  experiments  support  projections  of  a substantial increase in biomass and productivity of primary producers and  secondary  consumers,  but  a  decrease  by  &gt;40%  of  primary consumers (Nagelkerken et al., 2020). On longer time scales, alteration of  energy  flow  through  marine  food  webs  may  lead  to  ecological tipping points (Wernberg et al., 2016; Harley et al., 2017) after which the  food  web  collapses  into  shorter,  bottom-heavy  trophic  pyramids (medium confidence).Global projections anticipate a likely future reorganisation of marine life of variable magnitude, contingent on emission scenario (Beaugrand et  al.,  2015;  Jones  and  Cheung,  2015;  Barton  et  al.,  2016;  García Molinos  et  al.,  2016;  Nagelkerken  et  al.,  2020;  Henson  et  al.,  2021). Marine organism redistributions projected under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 include  extirpations  and  range  contractions  in  the  tropics,  strongly decreasing  tropical  biodiversity,  and  range  expansions  at  higher latitudes,  associated  with  increased  diversity  and  homogenisation of  marine  communities  (Figure  3.18b).  Under  continuing  climate change,  the  projected  loss  of  biodiversity  may  ultimately  threaten marine ecosystem stability (medium confidence) (Albouy et al., 2020; Nagelkerken  et  al.,  2020;  Henson  et  al.,  2021),  altering  both  the functioning  and  structure  of  marine  ecosystems  and  thus  affecting service provisioning (medium confidence) (Section 3.5; Ibarbalz et al., 2019; Righetti et al., 2019).However, biodiversity observations remain sparse, and statistical and modelling  tools  can  provide  conflicting  diversity  information  (e.g., Righetti  et  al.,  2019;  Dutkiewicz  et  al.,  2020)  because  correlative approaches  assume  that  the  modern-day  relationship  between marine  species  distribution  and  environmental  conditions  remains the  same  into  the  future,  whereas  mechanistic  models  permit marine  species  to  respond  dynamically  to  changing  environmental forcing.  Moreover,  existing  global  projections  of  future  biodiversity disproportionately  focus  on  the  effects  sea  surface  temperature (Thomas  et  al.,  2012),  typically  overlooking  other  factors  such as  ocean  acidification,  deoxygenation  and  nutrient  availability (Section 3.2.3), and often failing to account for natural adaptation (e.g., Section 3.3.4; see Box 3.1; Barton et al., 2016; Henson et al., 2021).441Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services3.4.3.3.3  Abrupt ecosystem shifts and extreme eventsClimate-change-driven  changes  in  ocean  characteristics  and  the frequency and intensity of extreme events (Section 3.2) increase the risk  of  persistent,  rapid  and  abrupt  ecosystem  change  (very  high confidence), often referred to as ecosystem collapses or regime shifts (AR6 WGI Chapter 9; Collins et al., 2019a; Canadell and Jackson, 2021; Ma  et  al.,  2021).  Such  abrupt  changes  include  altering  ecosystem structure,  function  and  biodiversity  outside  the  range  of  natural fluctuations (Collins et al., 2019a; Canadell and Jackson, 2021). They can  involve  mass-mortality  events  and  ‘tipping  points’  or  ‘critical transitions’, where strong positive feedbacks within an ecosystem lead to self-sustaining change (Figure 3.19a; Scheffer et al., 2012; Möllmann et  al.,  2015;  Biggs  et  al.,  2018). Abrupt  ecosystem  shifts  have  been observed in both large open-ocean ecosystems and coastal ecosystems (Section 3.4.2), with dramatic social consequences through significant loss of diverse ecosystem services (high confidence) (Section 3.5; Biggs et al., 2018; Pinsky et al., 2018; Beaugrand et al., 2019; Collins et al., 2019a; Filbee-Dexter et al., 2020b; Huntington et al., 2020; Trisos et al., 2020; Turner et al., 2020b; Canadell and Jackson, 2021; Ma et al., 2021; Ruthrof  et  al.,  2021). A  summary  of  previous  assessments  of  abrupt ecosystem shifts and extreme events is provided in Table 3.21.Abrupt  ecosystem  shifts  are  associated  with  large-scale  patterns of  climate  variability  (Alheit  et  al.,  2019;  Beaugrand  et  al.,  2019; Lehodey et al., 2020), some of which are projected to intensify with climate  change  (medium  confidence)  (WGI  AR6  Chapter  1;  Wang et al., 2017a; Collins et al., 2019a; Chen et al., 2021). Over the past 60  years,  abrupt  ecosystem  shifts  have  generally  followed  El  Niño/Southern  Oscillation  events  of  any  strength,  but  some  periods  had geographically limited ecological shifts (~0.25% of the global ocean in  1984–1987)  and  others  more  extensive  shifts  (14%  of  the  global ocean in 2012–2015) (medium confidence) (Figure 3.19b; Beaugrand et al., 2019). Typically, interacting drivers, such as eutrophication and overharvest,  reduce  ecosystem  resilience  to  climate  extremes  (e.g., MHWs, cyclones) or gradual warming, and hence promote ecosystem shifts (high confidence) (Figure 3.19a; Rocha et al., 2015; Biggs et al., 2018; Babcock et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2020b; Bergstrom et al., 2021; Canadell and Jackson, 2021; Tait et al., 2021). Also, shifts in different ecosystems  may  be  connected  through  common  drivers  or  through cascading effects (medium confidence) (Rocha et al., 2018a).Recent  MHWs  (Section  3.2.2.1)  have  caused  major  ecosystem  shifts and  mass  mortality  in  oceanic  and  coastal  ecosystems,  including corals, kelp forests and seagrass meadows (Sections 3.4.2.1, 3.4.2.3, 3.4.2.5,  3.4.2.6,  3.4.2.10;  Cross-Chapter  Box  MOVING  SPECIES  in Chapter 5; Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2), with dramatic declines in species foundational for habitat formation or trophic flow, biodiversity  declines,  and  biogeographic  shifts  in  fish  stocks  (very high  confidence)  (Table  3.15;  Cross-Chapter  Box  MOVING  SPECIES in  Chapter  5;  Canadell  and  Jackson,  2021).  Three  major  bleaching episodes  on  Australia’s  Great  Barrier  Reef  in  5  years  corresponded with extreme temperatures in 2016, 2017 and 2020 (Pratchett et al., 2021). Between 1981 and 2017, MHWs have increased more than 20-fold due to anthropogenic climate change (Section 3.2.2.1; WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Laufkötter et al., 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), increasing 3Changes in the latitudinal distribution of marine species richness(a) Observed species richness(b) Projected changes in species richnessLatitude50°0°-50°1995–20151975–19941955–1974RCP4.5RCP8.550°0°-50°0200040006000Species richness-100-50050100150200250% change in species richnessFigure 3.18 |  Changes in the latitudinal distribution of marine species richness.(a)  Observed species richness for three historical periods.

Latitudinal global median (5° moving average). (Based on Figure 1b,c in García Molinos et al., 2016.) The projected latitudinal patterns in changes in species richness under climate change are based on a numerical model that includes species-specific information across a suite of taxonomic groups, based on 12,796 marine species (García Molinos et al., 2016).442Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box 3.2 | Marine Birds and MammalsMarine  birds  (seabirds  and  shorebirds)  and  mammals  include  charismatic  species  and  species  that  are  economically,  culturally  and ecologically important (Sydeman et al., 2015; Albouy et al., 2020; Pimiento et al., 2020). Their long generation times and slow population growth suggests limited evolutionary resilience to rapid climate change (Section 3.3.4; Sydeman et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2018). According to the Red List Species Assessments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2020), the greatest current hazards to these groups include human use of biological resources and areas, invasive species and pollution (see Figure Box 3.2.1; Dias et al., 2019; Lusseau et al., 2021). Impacts of climate change and severe weather are ranked among the five most-important hazards influencing 131  and  45  bird  and  mammal  species,  respectively  (see  Figure  Box  3.2.1  for  selection  of  species),  including  24  bird  and  7  mammal species that are currently listed as endangered, critically endangered or threatened. Furthermore, according to these IUCN assessments, climate change and severe weather are expected to impact an additional 122 and 18 marine bird and mammal species over the next 50–100 years, respectively (see Figure Box 3.2.1; Dias et al., 2019).Hazard assessment for marine birds and mammalsSpecies currently impacted by different hazardsAdditional species expected to be exposed to these threats over the next 50–100 years350300250200150100500120100806040200isecepsdribeniramforebmuN)a(isecepslammameniramforebmuN)b(3ResidentialandcommercialdevelopmentAgricultureandaquacultureEnergyproductionand miningTransportation and servicecorridorsBiologicalresourceuseHumanintrusionsanddisturbanceNaturalsystemmodificationsInvasiveand otherproblematicspecies, genesand diseasesPollutionGeologicaleventsOtheroptionsClimatechangeandsevereweatherFigure Box 3.2.1 |  Hazard assessment for marine birds and mammals. Number of (a) marine birds and (b) mammals currently impacted by different hazards (blue), and numbers of additional species expected to be exposed to these threats over the next 50–100 years (red), as assessed in the International Union for Conservation of  Nature  Red  List  (IUCN,  2020).  Seabird  species  include  species  in  the  key  orders  Sphenisciformes,  Pelecaniformes,  Suliformes, Anseriformes,  Procellariiformes  and Charadriiformes categorised as inhabitants of marine ecosystems (n = 483 species, assessed in the period 2016–2019). Marine mammal species include the species reviewed by Lusseau et al. (2021) (n = 136 species, assessed in the period 2008–2019).Marine birds and mammals are vulnerable to climate-induced loss of breeding and foraging habitats such as sea ice (Section 3.4.2.12), sandy beaches (Section 3.4.2.6), salt marshes (Section 3.4.2.5) and seagrass beds (high confidence) (Section 3.4.2.5; Sydeman et al., 2015; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Ropert-Coudert et al., 2019; Von Holle et al., 2019; Albouy et al., 2020; Amano et al., 2020; Bestley et al., 2020; Grose et al., 2020). With warming, shorebird population abundances decline in the tropics, likely due to heat stress and habitat loss, and increase at higher latitudes (Amano et al., 2020). Marine mammals dependent on sea ice habitat are particularly vulnerable to warming (medium confidence) (Albouy et al., 2020; Bestley et al., 2020; Lefort et al., 2020), yet vulnerability can differ between populations. Ongoing sea ice 443          Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox 3.2 (continued)loss is decreasing some polar bear populations while others remain stable, likely related to past harvesting history, regional differences in sea ice phenology and ecosystem productivity (Hamilton and Derocher, 2019; Molnár et al., 2020). Nevertheless, even under an intermediate emission  scenario  RCP4.5,  increasing  ice-free  periods  will  likely  reduce  both  recruitment  and  adult  survival  across  most  polar  bear populations over the next four decades, threatening their existence (medium confidence) (see Figure Box 3.2.2; Molnár et al., 2020).Climate  change  is  affecting  marine  food-web  dynamics  (high  confidence)  (Sections  3.4.2,  3.4.3),  and  the  vulnerability  and  adaptive capacity  of  marine  birds  and  mammals  to  such  changes  is  linked  to  the  species’  breeding  and  feeding  ecology.  Higher-vulnerability species include central-place foragers (confined to, for example, breeding colonies fixed in space), diet and habitat specialists, and species with restricted distributions such as marine mammal populations in SES (medium confidence) (McMahon et al., 2019; Ropert-Coudert et al., 2019; Albouy et al., 2020; Grose et al., 2020; Sydeman et al., 2021). Surface-feeding and piscivorous marine birds appear to be more vulnerable to food-web changes than diving seabirds and planktivorous seabirds (medium confidence) (Sydeman et al., 2021). During the 2014–2015 Pacific heatwave, around 1 million piscivorous common murres died along a 1500 km coastal stretch in the Pacific USA due to reduced prey availability (Jones et al., 2018b; Piatt et al., 2020). Marine birds are vulnerable to phenological shifts in food-web dynamics,  as  they  have  limited  phenotypic  plasticity  of  reproductive  timing,  with  potentially  little  scope  for  evolutionary  adaptation (medium confidence) (Keogan et al., 2018), although changes in reproduction timing are observed in several species (Section 3.4.4.1; Sydeman et al., 2015; Descamps et al., 2019; Sauve et al., 2019). There is limited evidence of marine mammals’ capacity to adapt to shifting phenologies, but observed responses include changes in the onset of migrations, moulting and breeding (Section 3.4.4.1; Ramp et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2017; Beltran et al., 2019; Bowen et al., 2020; Szesciorka et al., 2020).3Modelled risk timelines for demographic impacts on circumpolar polar bear subpopulationsand associated confidence assessments, due to extended fasting periods with loss of sea ice(a) RCP4.5(b) RCP8.5Western Hudson BaySouthern Hudson  bayDavis StraitFoxe BasinBaffin BaySouthern Beaufort SeaChukchi SeaLaptev SeaKara SeaBarents SeaEast Greenland SeaNorthern Beaufort SeaQueen Elizabeth Islands198020002020204020802060198020002020204020802060Risk of demographic effects:Cub recruitmentAdult male survivalAdult female survivalPossibleLikelyVery likelyInevitableFigure  Box  3.2.2  |    Modelled  risk  timelines  for  demographic  impacts  on  circumpolar  polar  bear  subpopulations,  and  associated  confidence assessments, due to extended fasting periods with loss of sea ice. Years of first impact on cub recruitment (yellow), adult male survival (blue) and adult female survival (red) are shown for the (left) RCP4.5 and (right) RCP8.5. (Data from Molnár et al., 2020).444Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box 3.2 (continued)Increased emergence of infectious disease in mammals and birds is expected with ocean warming, due to new transmission pathways from changing species distributions, higher species densities caused by habitat loss and increased vulnerability due to environmental stress on individuals (limited evidence) (Sydeman et al., 2015; VanWormer et al., 2019; Sanderson and Alexander, 2020). Marine birds and mammals are likely to suffer from increased mortalities due to increasing frequencies of HABs, and of extreme weather, at sea, on sea ice, and in terrestrial breeding habitats (Broadwater et al., 2018; Gibble and Hoover, 2018; Ropert-Coudert et al., 2019; Grose et al., 2020). Also, climate-change  driven  distributional  shifts  have  strengthened  interactions  with  other  anthropogenic  impacts,  through,  for  example, increasing risks of ship strikes and bycatch (medium confidence) (e.g., Hauser et al., 2018; Krüger et al., 2018; Record et al., 2019; Santora et al., 2020).Table 3.21 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of observed and projected abrupt ecosystem shifts and extreme eventsObservationsProjectionsAR5 (Wong et al., 2014)Observations of abrupt ecosystem shifts and extreme events were not assessed in this report.SROCC (Collins et al., 2019a)‘Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades, including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses and kelps (very high confidence).’‘Warming and acidification will lead to coral bleaching, mortality, and decreased constructional ability (high confidence), making coral reefs the most vulnerable marine ecosystem with little scope for adaptation. Temperate seagrass and kelp ecosystems will decline with the increased frequency of heatwaves and sea temperature extremes as well as through the impact of invasive subtropical species (high confidence).’3‘Marine heatwaves are projected to further increase in frequency, duration, spatial extent and intensity (maximum temperature) (very high confidence). Climate models project increases in the frequency of marine heatwaves by 2081–2100, relative to 1850–1900, by approximately 50 times under RCP8.5 and 20 times under RCP2.6 (medium confidence).’‘Extreme El Niño and La Niña events are projected to likely increase in frequency in the 21st century and to likely intensify existing hazards, with drier or wetter responses in several regions across the globe. Extreme El Niño events are projected to occur about twice as often under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in the 21st century when compared to the 20th century (medium confidence).’‘Limiting global warming would reduce the risk of impacts of MHWs, but critical thresholds for some ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) will be reached at relatively low levels of future global warming (high confidence).’the  risk  of  abrupt  ecosystem  shifts  (high  confidence)  (Figure  3.19a; Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2; van der Bolt et al., 2018; Garrabou et al., 2021; Wernberg, 2021).3.4.3.3.4  Time of emergence: species exposure to altered environmentsEcosystems can recover from abrupt shifts (e.g., Babcock et al., 2019; Christie  et  al.,  2019;  Medrano  et  al.,  2020).  However,  where  climate change  is  a  dominant  driver,  ecosystem  collapses  increasingly  cause permanent  transitions  (high  confidence),  although  the  extents  of such transitions depend on the emission scenario (Trisos et al., 2020; Garrabou et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2021; Pratchett et al., 2021; Wernberg, 2021).  Over  the  coming  decades,  MHWs  are  projected  to  very  likely become more frequent under all emission scenarios (Section 3.2; WGI AR6  Chapter  9;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021),  with  intensities  and  rates too  high  for  recovery  of  degraded  foundational  species,  habitats  or biodiversity  (medium  confidence)  (Babcock  et  al.,  2019;  Garrabou et al., 2021; Klein et al., 2021; Serrano et al., 2021; Wernberg, 2021). Emission pathways that result in temperature overshoot above 1.5oC will increase the risks of abrupt and irreversible shifts in coral reefs and other vulnerable ecosystems (Section 3.4.4).Since  SROCC,  more  studies  have  assessed  the  time  of  emergence  for climate-induced  drivers  (Section  3.2.3)  and  the  ecosystem  attributes through which the impacts manifest. However, as in previous assessments (Table  3.22),  the  time  of  emergence  for  a  given  driver  or  ecosystem attribute  depends  on  the  reference  period,  the  definition  of  the  signal emergence  threshold  and  the  spatio-temporal  scales  considered  (see Box 5.1 in SROCC; Kirtman et al., 2013; Bindoff et al., 2019a).Anthropogenically  driven  changes  in  chlorophyll-a  concentrations across an ensemble of 30 ESMs are expected to exceed natural variability under  RCP8.5  by  2100  in  ~65–80%  of  the  global  oceans,  when  the natural variability is calculated using the ensemble’s standard deviation (Schlunegger et al., 2020); however, if two standard deviations are used, then  significant  trends  in  chlorophyll-a  concentration  are  expected under RCP8.5 across ~31% of the global oceans by 2100 (Dutkiewicz et  al.,  2019).  In  contrast,  the  anthropogenic  signal  in  phytoplankton community structure, which has a lower natural variability, will emerge under RCP8.5 across 63% of the ocean by 2100 when two standard deviations are used (limited evidence) (Dutkiewicz et al., 2019).445Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesObserved ecological regime shiftsand their drivers in the oceans(a)ShockCurrent stateCritical thresholdRegime 1Regime 2(b)stfihsytinummoctpurbafotnetxednaedutingamnitfihSnaecolaboglehtni10,0007,5005,0002,5000396019701980199020002010Figure 3.19 |  Observed ecological regime shifts and their drivers in the oceans.(a)  A  conceptual  representation  of  ecosystem  resilience  and  regime  shifts.  Shift from  Regime  1  to  Regime  2  can  be  triggered  by  either  a  large  shock  (i.e.,  an  abrupt environmental transition) or gradual internal or external change that erodes the dominant balancing feedbacks, reducing ecosystem resilience (indicated by the shallower dotted line, relative to the deeper ‘valley’ reflecting higher resilience). (Based on Biggs et al., 2018).(b)  The sum of the magnitude and extent of the abrupt community shifts that has been estimated at each geographic cell in the global ocean during 1960–2014, calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the change in a particular year to the average magnitude of the change over the entire time series (thus, is dimensionless). (Based on Beaugrand et al., 2019).The  time  of  emergence  of  climate  impacts  on  ecosystems  will  be modulated jointly by species-specific adaptation potential (Section 3.3.4; Jones and Cheung, 2018; Collins et al., 2020; Gamliel et al., 2020; Miller et  al.,  2020a),  speed  of  range  shifts  and  spatial  reorganisation  (high confidence)  (Sections  3.3,  3.4.2,  3.4.3).  These  ecosystem  responses complicate  projections  of  the  time  of  emergence  of  environmental properties  that  impact  biogeochemical  cycling  (Schlunegger  et  al., 2019;  Schlunegger  et  al.,  2020;  Wrightson  and  Tagliabue,  2020), ecosystem structure and biodiversity (Figure 3.20a,c; Dutkiewicz et al., 2019; Trisos et al., 2020), and higher trophic levels, including fisheries targets  (Cheung  and  Frölicher,  2020).  Better  accounting  for  multiple interacting factors in ESMs (see Box 3.1) will provide insight into how marine ecosystems will respond to future climate (high confidence).The  time  of  emergence  of  ecosystem  responses  supports  planning for  specific  time-bound  actions  to  reduce  risks  to  ecosystems (Section 3.6.3.2.1; Bruno et al., 2018; Trisos et al., 2020). Although under RCP8.5, climate refugia from SST after 2050 are primarily in the Southern Ocean in tropical waters, these refugia are mainly from deoxygenation (Bruno  et  al.,  2018).  Marine  assemblages  in  these  places  will  be exposed  to  unprecedented  temperatures  after  2050,  peaking  in  2075 (Figure 3.20a,b; Trisos et al., 2020). In contrast, changes in phytoplankton community structure will emerge earlier, primarily in the Pacific Ocean subtropics and through much of the North Atlantic Ocean (Figure 3.20c,d; Dutkiewicz  et  al.,  2019).  Under  RCP8.5,  changes  in  phytoplankton community structure and, to a lesser extent, exposure of marine species to unprecedented temperatures, will emerge earlier in marine protected areas (MPAs), covering ~7.7% of the global oceans (Section 3.6.2.3.2.1; UNEP-WCMC  and  IUCN,  2020;  UNEP-WCMC  and  IUCN,  2021)  as compared with non-MPAs (Figure 3.20b,d). Such assessment can support planning  for  future  MPA  placement  and  extent.  Because  MPAs  can serve  as  refugia  from  non-climate  drivers  (Sections  3.6.2.3,  3.6.3.2.1), they facilitate opportunities for adaptation among marine species and communities in coastal oceans (Section 3.4.2).3.4.3.4 Biomass3.4.3.4.1  Observed changesObserved  changes  in  biomass  in  the  global  ocean,  beyond  those  for phytoplankton (Table 3.23), have not routinely been attributed to climate-induced drivers, but rather to the compound effects of multiple drivers, especially fishing (Christensen et al., 2014; Palomares et al., 2020). We therefore do not assess observed changes in ocean biomass here.3.4.3.4.2  Projected changesBased on an ensemble of CMIP5 ESMs, SROCC projected declines in global zooplankton biomass by 2100 dependent on emission scenario (low confidence) (Table 3.23). The new CMIP6 ESM ensemble projects a  decline  in  global  zooplankton  biomass  by  −3.9  ±  8.2%  (very likely  range)  and  −9.0  ±  8.9%  in  the  period  2081–2100  relative  to 1995–2014 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (Figure 3.21d; Kwiatkowski  et  al.,  2020),  thus  reinforcing  the  SROCC  assessment albeit with greater inter-model uncertainties.Using  an  ensemble  of  global-scale  marine  ecosystem  and  fisheries models  (Fish-MIP)  (Tittensor  et  al.,  2018)  with  the  CMIP5  ESM ensemble,  SROCC  concludes  that  projected  ocean  warming  and decreased phytoplankton production and biomass will reduce global marine animal biomass during the 21st century (medium confidence). The simulated declines (with very likely range) are −3.5 ± 4.8% and −14.0  ±  14.6%  under  RCP2.6  and  RCP8.5,  respectively,  by  2080–2099  relative  to  1995–2014  (SROCC  Section  5.2.3;  Bindoff  et  al., 2019a; Lotze et al., 2019)6. Updated Fish-MIP simulations with CMIP6 (Figure 3.21g,h,i) confirm the projected decline in total marine animal biomass  in  the  21st  century  (Tittensor  et  al.,  2021). The  simulated 6 SROCC reported that declines in total marine animal biomass have been recomputed using 1995–2014 as the baseline period and the very likely ranges (5–95%) are now computed from the model  ensemble ranges assuming a normal distribution.446           Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 3.3 | Are we approaching so-called tipping points in the ocean and what can we do about it?A tipping point is a threshold beyond which an abrupt or rapid change in a system occurs. Tipping points that have already been reached in ocean systems include the melting of sea ice in the Arctic, thermal bleaching of tropical coral reefs and the loss of kelp forests. Human-induced climate change will continue to force ecosystems into abrupt and often irreversible change, without strong mitigation and adaptation action.Where are we reaching tipping points in the ocean and what can we do about it?ArcticArcticArcticPacific NWPacific NWPacific NWPacific NEPacific NEPacific NEAtlantic NWAtlantic NWAtlantic NWAtlantic NEAtlantic NEAtlantic NEPacific NEPacific NEPacific NEIndianIndianIndianWestWestWestIndianIndianIndianEastEastEastSE AsiaSE AsiaSE AsiaPacific SWPacific SWPacific SWIndian E CBCIndian E CBCIndian E CBCPacific SWPacific SWPacific SWCalifornia EBUSCalifornia EBUSCalifornia EBUSCaribbeanCaribbeanCaribbeanSESSESSESPacific EquatorialPacific EquatorialPacific Equatorial3AntarcticaAntarcticaAntarcticaIce cover transitionIIIce cove ttr tran ititsitiiionCoral transitionKelp transitionWarmingExtreme eventsSea level riseWomen/vulnerable groups Indigenous peoplesSmall scale fishersSmall Island developing states TourismFisheriesTransportTransitionClimate change hazardsSocial vulnerability Economic vulnerability= no dataFigure FAQ3.3.1 |  Global map with examples of tipping points that have been passed in ocean systems around the world. Tipping points in ecological systems are linked to increasing impacts and vulnerability of dependent human communities. SES: semi-enclosed sea; EBUS: eastern boundary upwelling system; CBC; coastal boundary current.A gradual change in water temperature or oxygen concentration can lead to a fundamental shift in the structure and/or composition of an ecosystem when a tipping point is exceeded. For example, all species have upper temperature limits  below  which  they  can  thrive.  In  the  tropics,  prolonged  warm  temperatures  can  cause  fatal  ‘bleaching’  of tropical corals, leading reef ecosystems to degrade and become dominated by algae. In temperate regions, MHWs can kill or reduce the growth of kelp, threatening the other species that depend on the tall, canopy-forming marine plants  for  habitat.  In  the  Arctic,  rising  temperatures  are  melting  sea  ice  and  reducing  the  available  habitat  for communities of ice-dependent species.Once a tipping point is passed, the effects can be long-lasting and/or irreversible over time scales of decades or longer.  An  ecosystem  or  a  population  can  remain  in  the  new  state,  even  if  the  driver  of  the  change  returns  to previous levels. For example, once a coral reef has been affected by bleaching, it can take decades for corals to 447Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox FAQ 3.3 (continued)grow back, even if temperatures remain below the bleaching threshold. Crossing a tipping point can cause entire populations to collapse, causing local extinctions.Tipping  points  are  widespread  across  oceanic  provinces  and  their  ecosystems  for  climate  variables  like  water temperature,  oxygen  concentration  and  acidification.  Evidence  suggests  that  ocean  tipping  points  are  being surpassed more frequently as the climate changes; scientists have estimated that abrupt shifts in communities of marine species occurred over 14% of the ocean in 2015, up from 0.25% of the ocean in the 1980s. Other human stressors to the ocean, including habitat destruction, overfishing, pollution and the spread of diseases, combine with climate change to push marine systems beyond tipping points. As an example, nutrient pollution from land together with climate change can lead to low-oxygen coastal areas referred to as ‘dead zones’.Human  communities  can  also  experience  tipping  points  that  alter  people’s  relationships  with  marine  ecosystem services. Indigenous Peoples and local communities may be forced to move from a particular location due to SLR, erosion or loss of marine resources. Current activities that help sustain Indigenous Peoples and their cultures may no longer be possible in the coming decades, and traditional diets or territories may have to be abandoned. These tipping points have implications for physical and mental health of marine-dependent human communities.Adaptation  solutions  to  the  effects  of  ecological  tipping  points  are  rarely  able  to  reverse  their  environmental impacts, and instead often require human communities to transform their livelihoods in different ways. Examples include diversifying income by shifting from fishing to tourism and relocating communities threatened by flooding to other areas to continue their livelihoods. Tipping points are being passed already in coral reefs and polar systems, and more will probably be reached in the near future given climate-change projections. Nevertheless, the chances of moving beyond additional tipping points in the future will be minimised if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we also act to limit other human impacts on the ocean, such as overfishing and nutrient pollution.3Table 3.22 |  Conclusions from previous IPCC assessments about projected time of emergence on coastal, ocean and deep-sea systemsOceanic systems and chapter subsectionCoastal (Section 3.4.2)Epipelagic (Section 3.4.3)Open ocean (Section 3.4.3)Deep sea (Box 3.3)Projections‘Multiple [climate-impact drivers] will emerge [...] in the 21st century under RCP8.5, while the time of emergence will be later and with less [climatic hazards] under RCP2.6. [Non-climate] impacts such as eutrophication add to, and in some cases, exacerbate these large-scale slow climate drivers beyond biological thresholds at local scale (e.g., deoxygenation)’ (Section 5.3.7 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘Observed range shifts in response to climate change in some regions such as the north Atlantic are strongly influenced by warming due to both multi-decadal [climate change and] variability, suggesting that there is a longer time of emergence of range shifts from natural variability and a need for longer biological time series for robust attribution’ (Section 5.2.3.1.1 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘[The timing] for five primary drivers of marine ecosystem change (surface warming and acidification, oxygen loss, nitrate concentration and net primary production change) are all prior to 2100 for over 60% of the ocean area under RCP8.5 and over 30% under RCP2.6 (very likely)’ (Figure 1 in Box 5.1 in SROCC, Box 5.1 in SROCC, Executive Summary in SROCC Chapter 5; Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘Anthropogenic signals are expected to remain detectable over large parts of the ocean, even for the RCP2.6 scenario for pH and SST, but are likely [to be less conspicuous] for nutrients and NPP [net primary production] in the 21st century. For example, for the open ocean, the anthropogenic pH signal in Earth System Models’ (ESM) historical simulations is very likely to have emerged for three-quarters of the ocean prior to 1950, and it is very likely over 95% of the ocean has already been affected, with little discernible difference between scenarios’ (Executive Summary in SROCC Chapter 5, Box 5.1 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019a). ‘The climate signal of oxygen loss will very likely emerge by 2050 with a very likely range of 59–80% by 2031–2050 and rising with a very likely range of 79–91% of the ocean area by 2081–2100 (RCP8.5 emissions scenario). The emergence of oxygen loss is smaller in area for the RCP2.6 scenario in the 21st century and by 2090 the [area where emergence is evident is declining].’ It has also been shown that signatures of altered oxygen solubility or utilisation may emerge earlier than for oxygen levels (Executive Summary in SROCC Chapter 5, Box 5.1 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘Emergence of risk is expected to occur later at around the mid-21st century under RCP8.5 for abyssal plain and chemosynthetic ecosystems (vents and seeps)’ (Section 5.2.5 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019a). ‘All deep seafloor ecosystems are expected to be subject to at least moderate risk under RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century, with cold water corals undergoing a transition from moderate to high risk below 3°C’ (SM5.2 in SROCC; Bindoff et al., 2019b).448Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Time of exposure to altered environments(a)(c)MPANon-MPA(b)aerafonoitroporpevlitaeR(d)aerafonoitroporpevitaleR3200020202040206020802100200020202040206020802100Figure 3.20 |  Time of exposure to altered environments.(a)  Simulated spatial variation in the time of exposure of marine species to unprecedented temperatures under RCP8.5.

These declines result from combined  warming  and  decreased  primary  production  (with  low confidence in future changes in primary production; Section 3.4.3.5) and  are  amplified  at  each  trophic  level  within  all  ESM  and  marine ecosystem model projections across all scenarios (medium confidence) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Lotze et al., 2019; Tittensor et al., 2021). However, there is limited evidence about how underlying food-web mechanisms  amplify  the  climate  signal  from  primary  producers  to higher  trophic  levels,  and  several  putative  mechanisms  have  been proposed (Section 3.4.4.2.2; Chust et al., 2014a; Stock et al., 2014; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Lotze et al., 2019; Heneghan et al., 2021). As assessed in SROCC, the biomass projections contain considerable regional  variation  with  declines  in  tropical  to  temperate  regions and strong increases in total animal biomass are projected in polar regions under high-emission scenarios, with climate-change effects that are spatially similar but less pronounced under lower-emission scenarios (Figure 3.21b,c,e,f,h,i; Tai et al., 2019; Tittensor et al., 2021).SROCC  assessed  that  reduced  food  supply  to  the  deep  sea  will drive  a  reduction  in  abyssal  seafloor  biota  by  2100  for  RCP8.5 (Table  3.23).  Simulations  from  one  size-resolved  benthic  biomass model  coupled  to  an  ocean-biogeochemistry  model  forced  with  the CMIP5 ESM HadGEM2-ES (Yool et al., 2017) project a decline in the globally  integrated  total  seafloor  biomass  of  −1.1  and  −17.6%  by 2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively (limited evidence, high agreement).  In  waters  shallower  than  100 m,  total  benthic  biomass is projected to increase by 3.2% on average by 2100 under RCP8.5, primarily  driven  by  warming-increased  growth  rates  (Yool  et  al., 2013),  while  at  depths  &gt;2000 m  (representing  83%  of  the  ocean seafloor),  declines  of  −32%  arise  from  climate-driven  decreases  in surface primary production and POC flux to the seafloor (Yool et al., 2013; Kelly-Gerreyn et al., 2014; Yool et al., 2015; Yool et al., 2017). These patterns are qualitatively similar under RCP2.6, except in the 449      Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.23 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of changes in open ocean and deep-sea biomassObservationsProjectionsMeasureAR5 WGII (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014)Chlorophyll-a/phytoplankton biomass‘Phytoplankton biomass: the approximately 15-year archived time series of satellite-chlorophyll (as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass) is too short to reveal trends over time and their causes’ (WGII AR5 Section 6.1.2; Pörtner et al., 2014).‘Chlorophyll concentrations measured by satellites have decreased in the subtropical gyres of the North Pacific, Indian and North Atlantic oceans by 9, 12 and 11%, respectively, over and above the inherent seasonal and interannual variability from 1998 to 2010 (high confidence; p ≤ 0.05). Significant warming over this period has resulted in increased water-column stratification, reduced mixed-layer depth and possibly decreases in nutrient availability and ecosystem productivity (limited evidence, medium agreement). The short time frame of these studies against well-established patterns of long-term variability leads to the conclusion that these changes are about as likely as not due to climate change’ (WGII AR5 Chapter 30; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).Animal biomassObserved changes in animal biomass were not assessed in this report.3SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Chlorophyll-a/phytoplankton biomass‘[Changes reported] in overall open-ocean chlorophyll levels (a proxy of phytoplankton biomass) of less than ±1% yr–1 for individual time periods. Regionally, trends of ±4% between 2002 and 2015 for different regions are found when different satellite products are merged, with increases at high latitudes and moderate decreases at low latitudes’ (SROCC Section 5.2.2.6; Bindoff et al., 2019a).Animal biomassObserved changes in open-ocean and deep-sea biomass were not assessed in this report.‘Owing to contradictory observations there is currently uncertainty about the future trends of major upwelling systems and how their drivers (enhanced productivity, acidification and hypoxia) will shape ecosystem characteristics (low confidence)’ (WGII AR5 Chapter 6 Executive Summary; Pörtner et al., 2014).‘The climate-change-induced intensification of ocean upwelling in some eastern boundary systems, as observed in the last decades, may lead to regional cooling, rather than warming, of surface waters and cause enhanced productivity (medium confidence), but also enhanced hypoxia, acidification and associated biomass reduction in fish and invertebrate stocks’ (WGII AR5 Chapter 6 Executive Summary; Pörtner et al., 2014).Projected changes in chlorophyll-a/phytoplankton biomass were not assessed in this report.‘There is high agreement in model projections that global zooplankton biomass will very likely reduce in the 21st century, with projected decline under RCP8.5 almost doubled that of RCP2.6 (very likely). However, the strong dependence of the projected declines on phytoplankton production (low confidence) and simplification in representation of the zooplankton communities and food web render their projections having low confidence.’The global biomass of marine animals, including those that contribute to fisheries, is projected to decrease by 4.3 ± 2.0% (95% confidence interval) and 15.0 ± 5.9% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively, by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005, while the decrease is around 4.9% by 2031–2050 across all RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (very likely). Regionally, total animal biomass decreases largely in tropical and mid-latitude oceans (very likely).‘Projected decrease in upper-ocean export of organic carbon to the deep seafloor is expected to result in a loss of animal biomass on the deep seafloor by 5.2–17.6% by 2090–2100 compared to the present (2006–2015) under RCP8.5 with regional variations (medium confidence). Some increases are projected in the polar regions, due to enhanced stratification in the surface ocean, reduced primary production and shifts towards small phytoplankton (medium confidence). The projected impacts on biomass in the abyssal seafloor are larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 (very likely).’WGI AR6 Chapter 2 (Gulev et al., 2021)Chlorophyll-a/phytoplankton biomass450The multi-sensor time series of chlorophyll-a concentration has been updated to cover two decades (1998–2018).‘Global trends in chlorophyll-a for the last two decades are insignificant over large areas of the global oceans, but some regions exhibit significant trends, with positive trends in parts of the Arctic and the Antarctic waters (&gt;3% yr–1), and both negative and positive trends (within ±3% yr–1) in parts of the tropics, subtropics and temperate waters.’‘In the last two decades, the concentration of phytoplankton at the base of the marine food web, as indexed by chlorophyll concentration, has shown weak and variable trends in low and mid-latitudes and an increase in high latitudes (medium confidence).’Projected changes in open-ocean and deep-sea biomass were not assessed in this report.Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, where some increased total seafloor biomass is projected (Yool et al., 2013). Updated simulations with the same benthic biomass model (Kelly-Gerreyn et al., 2014) forced with the CMIP6 ESM UKESM-1 project declines in total seafloor biomass of −9.8 and −13.0% by 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (Figure 3.21j,k,l). These projected changes in  benthic  biomass  are  based  on  limited  evidence.  Development  of ensemble  projections  forced  with  a  range  of  ESMs  and  a  benthic model that considers the ecological roles of temperature (Hunt and Roy,  2006;  Reuman  et  al.,  2014),  oxygen  (Mosch  et  al.,  2012)  and ocean acidification (Andersson et al., 2011) will provide opportunities to better quantify uncertainty in projected declines in total seafloor biomass under climate change.Overall,  ocean  warming  and  decreased  phytoplankton  production and  biomass  will  drive  a  global  decline  in  biomass  for  zooplankton (low  confidence),  marine  animals  (medium  confidence)  and  seafloor benthos  (low  confidence),  with  regional  differences  in  the  direction and  magnitude  of  changes  (high  confidence).  There  is  increasing evidence  that  responses  will  amplify  throughout  the  food  web  and at  ocean  depths,  with  relatively  modest  changes  in  surface  primary producers translating into substantial changes at higher trophic levels and for deep-water benthic communities (medium confidence).3.4.3.5 Changes in Primary Production and Biological Carbon Export Flux3.4.3.5.1  Observed changes in primary productionAnalyses  of  satellite-derived  primary  production  over  the  past  two decades (1998–2018) showed generally weak and negative trends (up to  −3.0%)  at  low  and  mid  latitudes  (Kulk  et  al.,  2020).  In  contrast, positive trends occurred in large areas of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans, as well as in polar and coastal (upwelling) regions (up to +4.5%; Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Kulk et al., 2020). Data-assimilating ocean  biogeochemical  models  estimate  a  global  decline  in  primary production  of  2.1%  per  decade  in  the  period  1998–2015,  driven  by the shoaling mixed layer and decreasing nitrate concentrations (Gregg and  Rousseaux,  2019). This  is  consistent  with  previous  assessments that identified ocean warming and increased stratification as the main drivers (high confidence) affecting the regional variability in primary production Bindoff et al. (2019). However, as noted in SROCC and WGI AR6 Chapter 2 (Table 3.24; Gulev et al., 2021), observed interannual changes  in  primary  production  on  global  and  regional  scales  are nonlinear  and  largely  influenced  by  natural  temporal  variability, providing low confidence in the trends.3.4.3.5.2  Projected changes in primary productionAcross 10 CMIP5 and 13 CMIP6 ESM ensembles, global mean NPP is projected to decline by 2080–2099 relative to 2006–2015, under all RCPs and SSPs (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). However, under comparable radiative forcing, the CMIP6 multi-model mean projections of primary production  declines  (mean  ±  SD:  −0.56  ±  4.12%  under  SSP1-2.6, and −3.00 ± 9.10% under SSP5-8.5) are less than those of previous CMIP5 models (3.42 ± 2.47% under RCP2.6, and 8.54 ± 5.88% under RCP8.5) (WGI AR6 Section 5.4.4.2; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Canadell et al., 2021). The inter-model uncertainty associated with CMIP6 NPP projections is larger than in CMIP5, and it is consistently larger than the  scenario  uncertainty.  For  each  SSP  across  the  CMIP6  ensemble, individual  models  project  both  increases  and  decreases  in  global primary production, reflecting a diverse suite of bottom-up and top-down ecological processes, which are variously parameterised across models  (Laufkötter  et  al.,  2015;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  Furthermore, accurate simulation of many of the biogeochemical tracers upon which NPP  depends  (e.g.,  the  distribution  of  iron;  Tagliabue  et  al.,  2016; Bindoff et al., 2019a) remains a significant and ongoing challenge to ESMs (high confidence) (Séférian et al., 2020).Regionally,  multi-model  mean  changes  in  primary  production  show generally similar patterns of large declines in the North Atlantic and the  western  equatorial  Pacific,  while  in  the  high  latitudes,  primary production  consistently  increases  in  CMIP5  and  CMIP6  by  2100 (Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). In the Indian Ocean and subtropical North Pacific, which were regions of consistent NPP decline in CMIP5 projections (Bopp et al., 2013), the regional declines are  reduced  in  magnitude,  less  spatially  extensive  and  are  typically less robust in CMIP6. Further assessment of simultaneous changes in processes such as nutrient advection, nitrogen fixation, the microbial loop  and  top-down  grazing  pressure  (WGI  AR6  Section  5.4.4.2; Laufkötter et al., 2015; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Canadell et al., 2021) are required to fully understand the regional primary production response in CMIP6 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Given the regional variations in the estimates of primary production changes and the uncertainty in the representation of the dominant drivers, there remains low confidence in the projected global decline in NPP.3.4.3.5.3  Observed processes driving changes in global export fluxThe SROCC medium confidence assessment that warming, stratification, declines  in  productivity  and  changes  in  plankton  community  in  the epipelagic zone result in reduced export of primary production to deeper layers (Table 3.24) is supported by subsequent literature (Bach et al., 2019; Leung et al., 2021). Particulate organic carbon export efficiency is constrained by altered mixing and nutrient availability (Boyd et al., 2019;  Lundgreen  et  al.,  2019),  particle  fragmentation  (Briggs  et  al., 2020) as well as viral, microbial and planktonic community structure (Fu et al., 2016; Guidi et al., 2016; Flombaum et al., 2020; Kaneko et al., 2021)  and  metabolic  rates  (Cavan  et  al.,  2019). These  processes  are strongly interlinked, and their net effect on primary production export from  the  upper  ocean  remains  difficult  to  quantify  observationally (Boyd  et  al.,  2019).  Since  SROCC,  there  is  increasing  evidence  that ocean  deoxygenation  can  alter  zooplankton  community  structure (Wishner et al., 2018), zooplankton respiration rates (Cass and Daly, 2014;  Cavan  et  al.,  2017)  and  patterns  of  diel  vertical  migration (Aumont  et  al.,  2018),  which  may  focus  remineralisation  of  organic carbon at the upper margins of OMZs (Section 3.4.3.4 on depth shifts due to OMZ; Bianchi et al., 2013; Archibald et al., 2019).Data on export flux from the upper ocean are limited either in coverage and  consistency  (ship-board  sampling)  or  duration  (sediment  traps), and  are  subject  to  considerable  spatial  variability  (as  shown  in satellite observations (Boyd et al., 2019). As a result, trends are weak, inconsistent and often not statistically significant (Lomas et al., 2010; 3451Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesProjected change in marine biomass(b)(e)(h)(k)SSP1-2.6SSP5-8.5(a))%l(notknapotyhPΔ(d))%(notknapooZΔl(g))%(ilamnAΔ)%(cihtneBΔ(j)100-10-20-30100-10-20-30100-10-20-30100-10-20-303SSP1-2.6(c)SSP5-8.5(f)(i)(l)2025205020752100-40%-30%-20%-10%%0Biomass anomaly10%20%30%40%Figure 3.21 |  Projected change in marine biomass.

(2021) include six to nine published global fisheries and marine ecosystem models from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Tittensor et al., 2018; Tittensor et al., 2021), forced with standardised outputs from two CMIP6 ESMs. For panels (j,k,l), globally integrated changes in total seafloor biomass have been updated based on Yool et al. (2017) with one benthic model (Kelly-Gerreyn et al., 2014) forced with the CMIP6 ESM UKESM-1.Cael  et  al.,  2017;  Muller-Karger  et  al.,  2019;  Xie  et  al.,  2019).  Deep-ocean fluxes are similarly equivocal (Smith et al., 2018; Fischer et al., 2019; Fischer et al., 2020). In coming years, an increasing number of Argo  floats  equipped  with  bio-optical  sensors  should  help  improve estimates  of  particle  flux  spatio-temporal  variability  (e.g.,  Dall’Olmo et al., 2016).Projected changesSROCC and WGI AR6 reported global declines in POC export flux, from −8.9  to  −15.8%  by  2100  relative  to  2000  under  RCP8.5  in  CMIP5 models, and −2.5 to −21.5% (median value: −14%) between 1900 and  2100  under  SSP5-8.5  in  CMIP6  models  (Table  3.24;  WGI  AR6 5.4.4.2; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Canadell et al., 2021). In CMIP5 model runs, the decrease in the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean into the ocean interior was strongly related to the changes in 452    Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Table 3.24 |  Summary of previous IPCC assessments of ocean primary production and carbon export fluxProcessObserved impactsProjected impactsSROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019a)Open-oceanprimary productionOpen-ocean carbon export‘Past open-ocean productivity trends, including those determined by satellites, [are appraised with low confidence] due to newly identified region-specific drivers of microbial growth and the lack of corroborating in situ time series datasets.’‘Analyses of long-term trends in primary production and particle export production, as well as model simulations, reveal that increasing temperatures, leading to enhanced stratification and nutrient limitation, will have the greatest influence on decreasing the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the deep ocean. However, different lines of evidence (including observation, modelling and experimental studies) provide low confidence on the mechanistic understanding of how climate drivers affect different components of the biological pump in the epipelagic ocean, as well as changes in the efficiency and magnitude of carbon export in the deep ocean.’‘Net primary productivity (NPP) is very likely to decline by 4–11% by 2081–2100, relative to 2006–2015, across CMIP5 models for RCP8.5, but there is low confidence for this estimate due to the medium agreement among models and the limited evidence from observations. The tropical ocean NPP will very likely to decline by 7–16% for RCP8.5, with medium confidence as there are improved constraints from historical variability in this region.’‘The projected changes in export production can be larger than global primary production because they are affected by both, the NPP changes, but also how shifts in food-web structure modulates the ‘transfer efficiency’ of particulate organic material, which then affects the sinking speed and lability of exported particles through the ocean interior to the sea floor.’‘As export production is a much better understood net integral of changing net nutrient supply and can be constrained by interior ocean nutrient and oxygen levels, there is medium confidence in projections for global [export production] changes [based on CMIP5 model runs].’WGI AR6 Chapters 2, 5 (Canadell et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021)3Open-oceanprimary productionGlobal ocean marine primary production is estimated to be 47 ± 7.8 PgC yr–1 with low confidence because of the small number of recent studies and the insufficient length of the time series analysed. A small decrease in productivity is evident globally for the period 1998–2015, but regional changes are larger and of opposing signs (low confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 2.3.4.2.2; Gulev et al., 2021).‘In CMIP5 models run under RCP8.5, [POC] export flux is projected to decline by 1–12% by 2100 (Taucher and Oschlies, 2011; Laufkötter et al., 2015). Similar values are predicted in 18 CMIP6 models, with declines of 2.5–21.5% (median: −14%) [...] between 1900 and 2100 under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The mechanisms driving these changes vary widely between models due to differences in parameterisation of particle formation, remineralisation and plankton community structure’ (WGI AR6 Section 5.4.4.2; Canadell et al., 2021).stratification that reduce net nutrient supply (Fu et al., 2016; Bindoff et  al.,  2019a),  especially  in  tropical  regions,  and  the  projections for  global  export  production  changes  are  reported  with  medium confidence.  Increasing  model  complexity  with  more  widespread representation  of  ocean  biogeochemical  processes  between  CMIP5 and CMIP6, and inclusion of more than one or two classes of phyto- and zooplankton, will provide opportunities to improve assessments of  how  climate-induced  drivers  affect  different  components  of biological carbon pump in the epipelagic ocean, as well as changes in the efficiency and magnitude of carbon export in the deep ocean (high confidence) (see Box 3.3; Le Quéré et al., 2016; Séférian et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2021).3.4.4 Reversibility and Impacts of Temporary Overshoot of 1.5°C or 2°C WarmingScenarios  limiting  warming  to  the  1.5°C  and  2°C  limits  in  the  Paris Agreement  can  involve  temporarily  exceeding  those  warming  levels before declining again (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021). The effect of such ‘overshoot’ on marine and coastal ecosystems depends on  the  reversibility  of  both  the  response  of  climate-induced  drivers and the response of organisms and ecosystems to the climate impact-drivers during the overshoot period. WGI AR6 assessed that temporary overshoot of a 2°C warming threshold has irreversible effects on global mean  sea  level  and  also  effects  on  ocean  heat  content  that  persist beyond 2100 (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021). Model results indicate that sea surface temperatures (high confidence), Arctic sea ice (high  confidence),  surface  ocean  acidification  (very  high  confidence) and surface ocean deoxygenation (very high confidence) are reversible within  years  to  decades  if  net  emissions  reach  zero  or  below  (WGI AR6 Table  4.10;  Lee  et  al.,  2021). Although  changes  in  these  surface ocean  variables  are  reversible,  habitat-forming  ecosystems,  including coral reefs and kelp forests, may undergo irreversible phase shifts with &gt;1.5°C warming (Sections 3.4.2.1, 3.4.2.3), and are thus at high risk this  century  in  1.5°C  or  2°C  scenarios  involving  overshoot  (Tachiiri et  al.,  2019).  In  an  overshoot  scenario  in  which  CO2  returns  to  2040 levels by 2100 (SSP5-3.4-OS; O’Neill et al., 2016), SST and Arctic sea ice do not fully return by 2100 to levels prior to the CO2 peak (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021), suggesting that reversal of marine ecological impacts from 21st century climate impacts would extend into the 22nd century or beyond (McManus et al., 2021). Models  also  indicate  that  global  sea  level  rise,  as  well  as  warming, ocean  acidification  and  deoxygenation  at  depth,  are  irreversible  for centuries or longer (very high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1 and Table 4.10; Palter et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020c; Lee et al., 2021).453Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox 3.3 | Deep-Sea EcosystemsDeep-sea ecosystems include all waters below the 200-m isobath as well as the underlying benthos, and they provide habitats for highly diversified and specialised biota, which play a key role in the cycling of carbon and other nutrients (see Figure Box 3.3.1; Thurber et al., 2014; Middelburg, 2018; Snelgrove et al., 2018). The deep sea covers &gt;63% of Earth’s surface (Costello and Cheung, 2010) and is exposed to climate-driven changes in abyssal, intermediate and surface waters that influence sinking fluxes of particulate organic matter (high confidence) (see Figure Box 3.3.1; Sections 3.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.4.3.4; WGII AR5 Section 30.5.7; SROCC Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019a). These ecosystems are also influenced by non-climate drivers, especially fisheries, oil and gas extraction (Thurber et al., 2014; Cordes et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019a); cable laying (United Nations, 2021); and mineral resource exploration (Hein et al., 2021); with proposed large-scale deep-sea mining a potential future source of impacts (Danovaro, 2018; Levin et al., 2020).Ocean  warming  alters  biological  processes  in  deep-sea  ecosystems  in  ways  that  affect  deep-sea  habitat,  biodiversity  and  material processing.  Enhancement  of  microbial  respiration  by  warming  attenuates  sinking  POC,  which  has  been  associated  with  the  globally projected declines in total seafloor biomass of −9.8 and −13.0% by 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively  (limited  evidence)  (Section  3.4.3.4). Additionally,  climate-change-driven  oxygen  loss  (Section  3.2.3.2;  Luna  et  al.,  2012; Belley et al., 2016) and geographic shifts in predator distributions (Section 3.4.3.1) are anticipated to affect deep-sea biodiversity (limited evidence, high agreement) (Smith et al., 2012; Morato et al., 2020). Complex responses of some bathyal crustacean assemblages to environmental change suggest an increase in phylogenetic diversity but limited decreases in abundances with temperature (Ashford et al., 2019). Acute mortality of some reef-forming cold-water corals to laboratory-simulated warming (Lunden et al., 2014) suggests that both long-term warming and the increase of MHWs in intermediate and deep waters (Elzahaby and Schaeffer, 2019) could pose significant  risk  to  associated  ecosystems  (high  confidence). Thermal  tolerance  thresholds  (lethal  and  sub-lethal)  of  scleractinians  in laboratory settings depend on their geographic position and capacity for thermal adaptation, as well as other factors including food, oxygen and pH (medium to high confidence) (Naumann et al., 2013; Hennige et al., 2014; Lunden et al., 2014; Naumann et al., 2014; Georgian et al., 2016; Gori et al., 2016; Maier et al., 2016; Büscher et al., 2017).3The extension and intensification of deep-water acidification (Section 3.2.3.1) has been identified as a further key risk to deep-water coral ecosystems (medium confidence) (Bindoff et al., 2019a). Literature since SROCC supports this assessment (Morato et al., 2020; Puerta et al., 2020), although scleractinians and gorgonians are found in regions undersaturated with respect to aragonite (Thresher et al., 2011; Fillinger and Richter, 2013; Baco et al., 2017). Laboratory experiments on reef-forming scleractinians show variable results, with regional acclimation potential and population-genetic adaptations (Georgian et al., 2016; Kurman et al., 2017). Desmophyllum pertusum7 and Madrepora oculata maintain calcification in moderately low pH (7.75) and near-saturation of aragonite (Hennige et al., 2014; Maier et al., 2016; Büscher et al., 2017), but lower pH (7.6) and corrosive conditions lead to net dissolution of D. pertusum skeletons (high confidence) (Lunden et al., 2014; Kurman et al., 2017; Gómez et al., 2018). Experiments suggest that D. dianthus is more sensitive to warming than acidification and when both are high, as projected under climate change. Warming appears to compensate for declines in calcification, with fitness also sensitive to food availability (Bramanti et al., 2013; Movilla et al., 2014; Gori et al., 2016; Baussant et al., 2017; Büscher et al., 2017; Schönberg et al., 2017; Höfer et al., 2018; Maier et al., 2019).In OMZ regions (Section 3.2.3.2), benthic species distributions (Sperling et al., 2016; Levin, 2018; Gallo et al., 2020), abundance and composition of demersal fishes in canyons (De Leo et al., 2012) and deep-pelagic zooplankton (Wishner et al., 2018) follow oxygen gradients,  indicating  that  deep-sea  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  structure  will  be  impacted  by  extension  of  hypoxic  areas  (medium confidence). Fossil records show benthic population collapse and turnover when oxygen ranged from oxic to mildly or severely hypoxic (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1; Moffitt et al., 2015). Regional extirpations among cold-water corals in the paleorecord were associated with substantial declines in oxygen, coincident with abrupt warming and altered properties of intermediate water-masses (Wienberg et al., 2018; Hebbeln et al., 2019). Despite mortality and functional impacts from low oxygen concentrations observed in aquaria (Lunden et al., 2014), recent observations of the deep-water coral D. pertusum suggest adaptive capacity to hypoxia among specimens from OMZ regions that are highly productive (low confidence) (Hanz et al., 2019; Hebbeln et al., 2020).Chemosynthetic ecosystems could be particularly prone to oxygen decline (low to medium confidence). Projected OMZ expansion in the vicinity of seep communities could favour sulphide-tolerant species, as suggested from fossil records (Moffitt et al., 2015), but this will exclude large symbiont-bearing foundation species of methane-seep ecosystems (Fischer et al., 2012; Sweetman et al., 2017). Projected warming, or shifts in warm-current circulation along continental margins, could enhance dissociation of buried methane hydrates (Phrampus and Hornbach, 2012; Phrampus et al., 2014), either increasing anaerobic methane oxidation (Boetius and Wenzhöfer, 2013), which benefits seep communities, or increasing gas fluxes, which would decrease anaerobic methane oxidation rates and exclude chemosynthetic fauna. 7 Previously named Lophelia pertusa454Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box 3.3 (continued)Environmental  niche  models  (FAO,  2019;  Morato  et  al.,  2020;  Puerta  et  al.,  2020)  project  that  under  RCP8.5,  &gt;50%  of  present-day scleractinian  habitats  in  the  North Atlantic  Ocean  will  become  unsuitable  by  2100,  with  greater  impacts  on  D.  pertusum  than  on  D. dianthus or M. oculata. For gorgonians, corresponding habitat loss is likely &gt;80%. Much less is known about the environmental niches of deep-sea sponges, preventing a similar assessment (Kazanidis et al., 2019; Puerta et al., 2020).Climate-driven impacts further limit the resilience of deep-sea ecosystems to impacts from human activities (high confidence) (Levin and Le Bris, 2015; Rogers, 2015; Sweetman et al., 2017). However, assessing cumulative climatic and non-climatic impacts is challenging for these data-poor environments (Ashford et al., 2018; Levin, 2018; Armstrong et al., 2019; Heffernan, 2019; Kazanidis et al., 2020; Orejas et al., 2020), where lack of knowledge increases the possibility of overlooking ecosystem vulnerabilities and risks (Levin, 2021). A paucity of information about the natural variability and historical trends of these habitats prevents robust assessment of adaptive capacities and potential vulnerabilities to extreme events (Aguzzi et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2019; Chapron et al., 2020; Danovaro et al., 2020; Le Bris and Levin, 2020; Levin, 2021). The spatial resolution of CMIP5 models is too coarse to robustly project changes in mesoscale circulation at the seafloor  (Sulpis  et  al.,  2019),  on  which  deep-sea  ecosystems  depend  for  organic  material  supplies  and  dispersal  of  planktonic  and planktotrophic larvae (high confidence) (Fox et al., 2016; Mitarai et al., 2016; Dunn et al., 2018). Higher-resolution modelling from CMIP6 (Orr  et  al.,  2017),  multi-annual  and  high-frequency  records  of  ocean  bottom-water  properties  (Meinen  et  al.,  2020),  and  better understanding and accounting of biogeochemical mechanisms of organic carbon transport to the ocean interior is expected to improve this capacity (Boyd et al., 2019; Séférian et al., 2020).Schematic of the combination of climate-induced drivers in different deep-ocean ecosystems200 mSubmarine canyon, deep fjord2000–3000 mContinental slopeWarmingMHWChange in POCand O2 fluxesWarmingAcidificationAcidificationXXDecreased POC fluxDeoxygenationHypoxia extension/shrinking3XXDeoxygenationDecreasedPOC fluxSubmarinecanyon4000–6000 mVolcanic arcContinental marginSeamountsAbyssal plainAbyssal hillsOceanic ridgesFlank, crest, hotspots &amp; faultsVulnerable benthic habitatsCold-water coral habitatsSurface watersTrenchChemosynthesis-based ecosystemsIntermediate waters Bathyal and abyssal benthosAbyssal/hadal waters8000–11000 mBiological drivers           Physical drivers           Reduced/increased surface NPP and sinking rateReduced/increased dense shelf-water cascadingReduced vertical migratory abundance and activityReduced/increased dense shelf-water open convectionMortality of reef-building corals and reef dissolutionChange in vertical mixing and in sub-mesoscale circulationReduction of chemosynthetic production ratesReduced/increased upwellingXXFigure Box 3.3.1 |  The combination of climate-induced drivers in different deep-ocean ecosystems. (Key physical and biological drivers of change in the deep-sea and benthic habitats with specific vulnerabilities are discussed in Section 3.4.3.3.)4553Chapter 3 3.5 Vulnerability, Resilience, and Adaptive Capacity in Marine Social–Ecological Systems, Including Impacts on Ecosystem Services3.5.1 IntroductionThis  section  assesses  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  ecosystem services (Table 3.25; Chapter 1) and the outcomes on social–ecological systems, building on previous assessments (Table 3.26). Section 3.5.2 assesses  how  changes  in  biodiversity  influence  ecosystem  services. Then  Sections  3.5.3  and  3.5.4  assess  provisioning  services  (food and  non-food),  Section  3.5.5  assesses  supporting  and  regulating services,  and  Section  3.5.6,  cultural  services. Where  evidence  exists, the section evaluates how the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of social–ecological systems govern the manifestation of impacts on each ecosystem service.3.5.2 BiodiversityClimate change is a key agent of biodiversity change in numerous ocean and coastal ecosystems (very high confidence) (Table 3.26; Worm and Lotze, 2021), and climate change and biodiversity loss reinforce each other (Pörtner et al., 2021b). Biodiversity has changed in association with ocean warming and loss of sea ice (Sections 3.4.2.10, 3.4.3.3.3; Section  CCP6  2.4.2),  SLR  (Section  3.4.2;  Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in Chapter 3), coral bleaching (Section 3.4.2.1), MHWs (Sections 3.4.2.1–3.4.2.5)  and  upwelling  changes  (high  confidence)  (Section  3.4.2.9). Overlapping non-climate drivers (Section 3.1) also decrease ocean and coastal  ecosystem  biodiversity  (very  high  confidence)  (O’Hara  et  al., 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021b). There is medium confidence that local and regional  marine  biodiversity  losses  from  climate  disrupt  ecosystem services  provided  by  specific  ocean  and  coastal  species  or  places (Sections 3.5.3–3.5.6; Figure 3.23; Table 3.26; see Box 3.3; Dee et al., 2019a; Hossain, 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Teixeira et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2020; Pathak, 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020; Zunino et al., 2020; Archer et al., 2021). However, adaptive capacity varies greatly among ecosystems,  and  ecological  functions  sometimes  remain,  despite changes in species assemblages, as in certain coral reef communities (Richardson  et  al.,  2020).  Projected  changes  in  biodiversity  due  to climate change (Section 3.4.3.3.3) are expected to alter the flow and array of ocean and coastal ecosystem services (high confidence) (Smale et  al.,  2019;  Cavanagh  et  al.,  2021;  Ruthrof  et  al.,  2021; Worm  and Lotze, 2021), but data gaps hinder developing projections of ecosystem service  changes  detailed  enough  to  support  decision  making  (Rosa et al., 2020).Non-indigenous marine species are major agents of ocean and coastal biodiversity change, and climate and non-climate drivers interact to support  their  movement  and  success  (high  confidence)  (Iacarella et  al.,  2020).  At  times,  non-indigenous  species  act  invasively  and outcompete  indigenous  species,  causing  regional  biodiversity  shifts and altering ecosystem function, as seen in the Mediterranean region (high confidence) (e.g., Mannino et al., 2017; Bianchi et al., 2019; Hall-Spencer and Harvey, 2019; Verdura et al., 2019; García-Gómez et al., 2020;  Dimitriadis  et  al.,  2021).  Warming-related  range  expansions 456Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesof  non-indigenous  species  have  directly  or  indirectly  decreased commercially  important  fishery  species  and  nursery  habitat  (Booth et al., 2018). Non-indigenous species outperform indigenous species in  coastal  zones  experiencing  warming  and  freshening  (McKnight et al., 2021). Non-climate drivers, especially marine shipping in newly ice-free  locations  (Chan  et  al.,  2019),  fishing  pressure  (Last  et  al., 2011),  aquaculture  of  non-indigenous  species  (Mach  et  al.,  2017; Ruby  and Ahilan,  2018)  and  marine  pollution  and  debris  (Gall  and Thompson,  2015;  Carlton  et  al.,  2018;  Carlton  and  Fowler,  2018; Lasut et al., 2018; Miralles et al., 2018; Rech et al., 2018; Therriault et al., 2018), promote range shifts and movement of non-indigenous species  (high  confidence).  Non-climate  drivers  can  also  intensify the  ecological  effects  of  non-indigenous  species  (Geraldi  et  al., 2020).  Invasive  marine  species  can  alter  species  behaviour,  reduce indigenous  species  abundance,  reduce  water  clarity,  bioaccumulate more  heavy  metals  than  indigenous  species  and  inhibit  ecosystem resilience  in  the  face  of  extreme  events  (medium  confidence) (McDowell  et  al.,  2017;  Geburzi  and  McCarthy,  2018; Anton  et  al., 2019; Ruthrof et al., 2021). Risks from invasive species to the sources of  other  ecosystem  services  or  aquatic  goods,  including  valuable materials,  mining  activities,  shipping  or  ocean  energy  installations, have not been evaluated.Reducing  risk  to  ecosystem  functions  and  services  that  depend  on biodiversity  requires  an  integrated  approach  that  acknowledges the  close  linkages  between  the  climate  and  biodiversity  crises  and common  governance  challenges  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2021b).  Climate-(NbS), focused  solutions  that  employ  nature-based  solutions technological interventions interventions  and  socio-institutional (Section 3.6.2) can also safeguard biodiversity (Pörtner et al., 2021b), which in turn will help ocean and coastal ecosystems adapt to climate impacts  as  well  as  help  sustain  the  services  they  provide  to  people (Sections 3.5.3–3.5.6).3.5.3 Food ProvisionGlobally, about 17% of humans’ average per capita intake of animal protein  in  2017  came  from  marine  and  freshwater  wild-caught  and aquacultured  aquatic  animals  (Costello  et  al.,  2020;  FAO,  2020a). Per  capita  intake  of  seafood  is  50%  or  more  in  some  Small  Island Developing States (SIDS) (Vannuccini et al., 2018), and consumption per capita is 15 times higher in Indigenous Peoples than non-Indigenous Peoples  (Cisneros-Montemayor  et  al.,  2016).  Fishery  products  also supply  critical  dietary  micronutrients  worldwide  (Section  3.5.4.1; Hicks et al., 2019; Vianna et al., 2020). Marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture provide livelihoods for an estimated 10–12% of the world’s  population  (Barange  et  al.,  2018).  Fishing  and  aquaculture provide  women  and  their  families  with  substantial  amounts  of  food and  income  (Harper  et  al.,  2020b),  because  at  least  11%  of  small-scale  fishers  (Harper  et  al.,  2020b)  and  up  to  half  of  all  fishery  and aquaculture  workers  (FAO,  2018)  are  women.  This  section  assesses how climate-driven alterations of the abundance or nutritional quality of food from the sea could affect humans.

Model hindcasts have identified temperature-associated fisheries  reductions  worldwide  (Free  et  al.,  2019),  and  they  have implicated  overfishing  as  the  primary  non-climate  driver  increasing fishery  vulnerability  (Section  5.8.4;  Peck  and  Pinnegar,  2018;  Das et al., 2020). Catch composition is changing in many locations fished by  smaller-scale,  less-mobile  commercial,  artisanal  and  recreational fisheries  (high  confidence)  (Booth  et  al.,  2018; Townhill  et  al.,  2019; Young  et  al.,  2019b;  Robinson  et  al.,  2020;  Champion  et  al.,  2021). Limited  exceptions  have  been  noted,  with  wild  harvests  in  some places  remaining  stable  or  increasing  (e.g., Arreguín-Sánchez,  2019; Robinson et al., 2019b; Kainge et al., 2020). Where possible, fishers are maintaining harvests by broadening catch diversity, traveling poleward and changing gear and strategies (high confidence) (Section 3.6.3.1.2; Barange  et  al.,  2018;  Dubik  et  al.,  2019;  Townhill  et  al.,  2019).

However, the effect of these changes is not yet reflected in a weakening trend of the contemporary (1960–2019) ocean sink (high confidence)’ (WGI AR6 Chapter 5 Executive Summary; Canadell et al., 2021).‘The decline in warm water coral reefs is projected to greatly compromise the services they provide to society, such as...coastal protection (high confidence)...’ (SROCC SPM B.8.2; IPCC, 2019c).‘Emission scenarios SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 lead to warming of the surface ocean and large reductions of the buffering capacity, which will slow the growth of the ocean sink after 2050. Scenario SSP1-2.6 limits further reductions in buffering capacity and warming, and the ocean sink weakens in response to the declining rate of increasing atmospheric CO2. There is low confidence in how changes in the biological pump will influence the magnitude and direction of the ocean carbon feedback’ (WGI AR6 Chapter 5 Executive Summary; Canadell et al., 2021).‘Mangrove, seagrass, and salt marsh ecosystems offer important carbon storage and sequestration opportunities (limited evidence, medium agreement), in addition to ecosystem goods and services such as protection against coastal erosion and storm damage and maintenance of habitats for fisheries species’ (WGII AR5 Technical Summary).‘…under high emission scenarios, sea level rise and warming are expected to reduce carbon sequestration by vegetated coastal ecosystems (medium confidence); however, under conditions of slow sea level rise, there may be net increase in carbon uptake by some coastal wetlands (medium confidence)’ (SROCC Chapter 5; Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and their services put key cultural dimensions of lives and livelihoods at risk (medium confidence), including through shifts in the distribution or abundance of harvested species and diminished access to fishing or hunting areas. This includes potentially rapid and irreversible loss of culture and local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, and negative impacts on traditional diets and food security, aesthetic aspects, and marine recreational activities (medium confidence)’ (SROCC SPM B.8.4; IPCC, 2019c).‘Future shifts in fish distribution and decreases in their abundance and fisheries catch potential due to climate change are projected to affect income, livelihoods, and food security of marine resource-dependent communities (medium confidence).

Substantial  economic  losses  in  the  North American  Pacific Coast shellfish aquaculture industry in the 2000s assessed in SROCC (Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a)  and  WGII  AR5  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2014)  remain the  clearest  example  of  human  harm  from  ocean  acidification. Technology-based  adaptations (Section  3.6.3)  have  minimised aquaculture  losses  from  ocean  acidification,  including  early-warning systems to guide hatchery operations and culturing resilient shellfish 4593Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesstrains (Section 5.9.4; Barton et al., 2015a). Laboratory studies show that  ocean  acidification  decreases  the  fitness,  growth  or  survival  of many economically and culturally important larval or juvenile shelled mollusks  (high  confidence)  (Cao  et  al.,  2018;  Onitsuka  et  al.,  2018; Stevens and Gobler, 2018; Griffith et al., 2019a; Mellado et al., 2019) and of several valuable wild-harvest crab species (Barton et al., 2015a; Punt  et  al.,  2015;  Miller  et  al.,  2016;  Swiney  et  al.,  2017;  Gravinese et al., 2018; Tomasetti et al., 2018; Long et al., 2019; Trigg et al., 2019). Ocean acidification alters larval settlement and metamorphosis of fish in laboratory studies (high confidence) (Cattano et al., 2018; Espinel-Velasco et al., 2018), suggesting possible changes in fish survival and thus  fishery  characteristics.  Deoxygenation  can  decrease  size  and abundance of marine species and suppress trophic interactions (Levin, 2003), decrease the diversity within marine ecosystems (Sperling et al., 2016) while temporarily increasing catchability and increasing the risk of  overfishing  (Breitburg  et  al.,  2018)  and  decrease  the  ecosystem services provided by specific fisheries (Orio et al., 2021). The chronic effects  of  deoxygenation  on  wild  fisheries  are  complex  and  highly interactive with co-occurring drivers and overall ecosystem responses (medium evidence, high agreement) (Townhill et al., 2017; Rose et al., 2019).  Detecting  and  attributing  marine  ecosystem  responses  to ocean  acidification  and  deoxygenation  outside  of  laboratory  studies remains  challenging  because  of  the  strong  influence  of  co-occurring environmental changes on natural systems (Section 3.3.5; Rose et al., 2019; Doo et al., 2020).Ocean  and  coastal  organisms  will  continue  moving  poleward  under RCP8.5 (high confidence) (Section 3.4.3.1.3; Figure 3.18), and this is expected to decrease fisheries harvests in low latitudes and alter species composition  and  abundance  in  higher  latitudes  (high  confidence) (Table 3.26; Figure 3.23; Asch et al., 2018; Morley et al., 2018; Tai et al., 2019; Erauskin-Extramiana et al., 2020; Shelton et al., 2021). Species that succeed in new ranges or conditions may offer opportunities to diversify  regional  fisheries  or  aquaculture  (Sections  3.6.3.1.2,  5.8.4, 5.9.4;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a),  or  they  may  outcompete  indigenous species and act as invasive species (Sections 3.4.2.10, 3.5.2).Temperature  will  continue  to  be  a  major  driver  of  fisheries  changes globally, but other non-climate factors like organism physiology and ecosystem response (Section 3.3) and fishing pressure (Chapter 5), as well as other climate-induced drivers like acidification, deoxygenation and sea ice loss (Section 3.2), will play critical roles in future global and local fisheries changes (high confidence). Warming, acidification and  business-as-usual  fishing  policy  under  RCP8.5  are  projected to  place  around  60%  of  global  fisheries  at  very  high  risk  (medium confidence)  (Cheung  et  al.,  2018).  Model  intercomparison  showed that ocean acidification and protection affect ecosystems more than fishing pressure, and ecological adaptation will significantly determine impacts on fishery biomass, catch and value until approximately 2050 (medium  confidence)  (Olsen  et  al.,  2018).  Ecosystem  responses  to warming  water,  fishing  pressure,  food-web  changes,  MHWs  and  sea ice  algal  populations  have  been  responsible  for  highly  variable  or collapsing  populations  of  Northern  Hemisphere  high-latitude  forage fish  species  including  sand  lances  (Ammodytes  spp.),  Arctic  cod (Boreogadus saida), capelin (Mallotus catervarius) and herring (Clupea spp.)  (Lindegren  et  al.,  2018;  Steiner  et  al.,  2019;  Arimitsu  et  al., 2021; Suca et al., 2021). Declining stocks of forage fish are expected to  have  detrimental  effects  on  seabirds,  pelagic  fish  and  marine mammals (medium confidence) (Lindegren et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2019),  which  may  harm  dependent  human  communities,  including Arctic  Indigenous  Peoples  (low  confidence)  (Arctic  Monitoring  and Assessment Programme, 2018; Steiner et al., 2019). Modelled fishery futures  and  revenue  depend  on  environmental  scenario,  fishing-fleet  composition  and  management,  and  ocean  acidification  and temperature  responses  of  harvested  species  (high  confidence)  (Punt et al., 2014; Punt et al., 2015; Seung et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2017; Rheuban et al., 2018; Tai et al., 2019; Punt et al., 2020). Detrimental effects of ocean acidification are projected to begin emerging in specific fisheries by 2030 (limited evidence, high agreement) [(southern Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) (Punt et al., 2015); sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus)  (Rheuban  et  al.,  2018);  Northeast  Arctic  cod  (Gadus morhua) (Hänsel et al., 2020); Arctic fisheries (Lam et al., 2016)]. At the same time, projected hypoxic conditions of ~2 mg l–1 of oxygen will be consistently detrimental across taxonomic groups, developmental stages and climate regions (high confidence) (Sampaio et al., 2021). Ecosystem-based management (Section 3.6.3.1.2) shows promise for decreasing  risk  from  interacting  climate  and  non-climate  drivers  to forage species and fished species.3.5.4 Other Provisioning Services3.5.4.1  Non-Food Consumable ProductsThe  interaction  of  climate  and  non-climate  drivers  endangers  the supply  of  non-food  consumable  products  developed  from  marine organisms  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  This  broad  class includes nutraceuticals (derived from fish, krill, shellfish, seaweeds and microbes), food preservatives or additives (derived from crustaceans, fish, microalgae and seaweeds, and cyanobacteria), pharmaceuticals (derived  from  fish,  shellfish,  microbes,  cyanobacteria,  corals  and sponges) or cosmetic products (derived from sponges, phytoplankton and  seaweeds,  fish  etc.)  (Freitas  et  al.,  2012;  Dewapriya  and  Kim, 2014;  Leal  and  Calado,  2015;  Stengel  and  Connan,  2015;  Greene et al., 2016; Ciavatta et al., 2017; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez et al., 2018). But  biodiversity  changes,  warming,  acidification  and  non-climate drivers  (especially  fishing  pressure)  may  decrease  the  availability of  these  organisms  or  the  potency  of  the  compounds  they  produce (Section  5.7.5.1;  Figure  3.23; Table  3.26; Webster  and Taylor,  2012; Mehbub et al., 2014; Kotta et al., 2018; Martins et al., 2018; Conrad et al., 2021). Observed and projected declines and movement of fish stocks  due  to  fishing  pressure  and  climate  change  impacts  (IPCC, 2019b) have generated concerns that the supply and safety of fish and krill oil for human dietary supplements may decline (Section 5.7.5.1; Gribble et al., 2016; Lloret et al., 2016). This risk can be lowered by technological adaptations (Section 3.6.2.2), such as increasing the use of alternative sources like marine phytoplankton, macroalgae, marine microbes (Dewapriya and Kim, 2014; Greene et al., 2016; Dave and Routray, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020) and underutilised resources such as fish, seal, crab and shrimp byproducts (Dave and Routray, 2018), and by improving extraction and processing efficiency (Cashion et al., 2017).  Climate  effects  on  non-food  consumable  products  could  be widespread yet poorly detected, complicating assessment of impacts, risks and vulnerability reduction.460Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3There is insufficient evidence to develop global projections of future climate impacts on humans through changes in non-food consumable marine products, but specific local examples have been investigated, such as the Arctic ooligan (eulachon; Thaleichthys pacificus), a small smelt fish. Ooligan grease has been used by Indigenous Peoples of the North Pacific coast (Phinney et al., 2009) for at least 5000 years to treat stomach  aches,  colds  and  skin  conditions,  and  as  a  traditional  food source high in omega-3 fatty acids (Byram and Lewis, 2001; Cranmer, 2016; Patton et al., 2019). Analysis of remains have shown that ooligan could  comprise  up  to  67%  of  traditional  historical  fisheries  catches (Patton et al., 2019). Because ooligan spawning relies on the timing of the spring freshet, and because the species has declined in the past 25 years due to fishing pressure and predation, the species may be at risk from combined climate-induced and non-climate drivers (medium confidence)  (Talloni-Álvarez  et  al.,  2019).  Projections  under  RCP2.6 or  RCP8.5  estimate  reductions  by  21  or  31%  by  2050  in  essential nutrients from traditional seafood for Indigenous Peoples in Canada, relative to 2000, with a modelled nutritional deficit that includes non-traditional dietary substitutions (Marushka et al., 2019).3.5.4.2  Non-Consumable GoodsLimited evidence about climate impacts exists for valuable non-food aquatic  materials.  Ocean  warming  and  acidification  harm  red  coral (Corallium rubrum) (Bramanti et al., 2013) and communities hosting black coral (Antipatharian spp.), both used for jewellery (Ross et al., 2020).  While  no-take  MPAs  (Section  3.6.3.2)  enhance  red-coral structural complexity, they only weakly compensate for warming effects (Cerrano et al., 2013; Montero-Serra et al., 2019). Antipatharian spp. are not well studied or monitored (Gress and Andradi-Brown, 2018). Acidification and warming negatively impact pearl oysters (Welladsen et al., 2010; Liu and He, 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014;  Zhang  et  al.,  2019b).  For  example,  projected  climate  impacts for  2035  would  decrease  the  average  net  present  value  of  French Polynesia’s  pearl  aquaculture  industry  by  29.1%  compared  with  the present  (Hilsenroth  et  al.,  2021).  Climate  impacts  on  ornamental species  sought  by  aquarists  have  not  been  well  studied  (Dee  et  al., 2019b).installations, Decreasing  the  vulnerability  of  renewable-energy particularly wind turbines, to climate risks (Table 3.26; Bindoff et al., 2019a) could include technological adaptations (Section 3.6.2.2) such as  storm ‘survival  mode’  settings  (Penalba  et  al.,  2018);  preparation for hazards such as icing, SLR, drifting sea ice and wave activity (Neill et al., 2018; Goodale and Milman, 2019; Solaun and Cerdá, 2019); and biofouling (medium confidence) (Want and Porter, 2018; Joyce et al., 2019; Vinagre et al., 2020), which is expected to increase in response to warming and acidification (medium confidence) (Dobretsov et al., 2019;  Khosravi  et  al.,  2019;  Liu  et  al.,  2020d;  Lamim  and  Procópio, 2021).  Macroalgae  and  fish-processing  byproducts  are  being  tested for biofuel use (Greene et al., 2016; Alamsjah et al., 2017; Saifuddin and Boyce, 2017; Sakthivel et al., 2018; Sudhakar et al., 2019; Nguyen et al.,  2020; Ramachandra  and  Hebbale, 2020; Tan et al.,  2020), but weather  variability  could  pose  financial  risk  to  this  sector  (Kleiman et al., 2021).33.5.5 Supporting and Regulating ServicesOcean and coastal regulating services are detailed in Table 3.25. The economic  value  of  all  regulating  ecosystem  services  in  2015  was estimated  at  29.1  trillion  USD,  with  water-  and  climate-regulating services contributing the most (Balasubramanian, 2019).3.5.5.1  Habitat Creation and Maintenance, and Larval DispersalClimate  impacts  have  already  altered  ocean  and  coastal  habitats (Section 3.4.2; Table 3.26; Gissi et al., 2021) in ways that have led to species  range  shifts,  biodiversity  changes,  phenology  changes  and regime  shifts  (Section  3.4.3)  from  the  surface  ocean  to  the  seafloor (very high confidence) (see Box 3.3; Figure 3.22). Continued ocean and coastal habitat impacts are projected, and their severities will depend on emissions scenario and co-occurring drivers (Section 3.4.3; Qiu et al., 2019)  or  extremes  (e.g.,  Babcock  et  al.,  2019). Warming  and  physical circulation  are  projected  to  change  larval  dispersal,  a  habitat-related service  (Bashevkin  et  al.,  2020),  but  identifying  probable  outcomes remains  challenging  owing  to  the  high  variability  among  species, locations  and  recruitment  (Schilling  et  al.,  2020;  King  et  al.,  2021;  Le Corre et al., 2021; Raventos et al., 2021). Climate risks to habitat can be decreased by reducing non-climate drivers, preserving ecosystems or restoring habitat (Sections 3.6.2, 3.6.3.2). Risk to larval dispersal cannot be meaningfully addressed at scale by human-implemented adaptations; instead, declines in this service will pressure natural systems to adapt via physiological plasticity or evolution (Section 3.3; Bashevkin et al., 2020).3.5.5.2 Climate Regulation and Air QualityClimate regulation by the ocean depends on physical and biogeochemical processes (Sections 3.2–3.4) that create, move, and store heat, water vapour  and  other  climate-active  compounds  including  CO2,  methane and dimethyl sulphide (WGI AR6 Chapter 6; Szopa et al., 2021). Over the 21st century, ocean heat and CO2 uptake will continue (WGI AR6 SPMB4.1, B5.1; IPCC, 2021b) and sea ice loss from warming will allow some  additional  CO2  uptake  (Armstrong  et  al.,  2019),  but  the  ocean will  take  up  a  smaller  fraction  of  CO2  emissions  as  atmospheric  CO2 concentrations rise (high confidence) (Table 3.26; WGI AR6 SPM B4.1; IPCC, 2021b).There is very limited evidence on climate-driven air-quality changes in the  coastal  zone.  Increased  humidity  decreases  the  lifetime  of  ozone and  increases  particulate  matter  and  indoor  mould  levels  (USGCRP, 2016),  potentially  affecting  near-shore  air  quality.  However,  coastal-zone air pollution can enhance coastal-climate impacts by increasing the risk of acid rain, which worsens ocean acidification (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and mercury; Doney, 2010; Northcott et al., 2019).3.5.5.3 Provision of Freshwater, Maintenance of Water Quality and Regulation of PathogensThe  salinities  of  many  estuaries,  deltas,  coastal  freshwater  aquifers and soils around the world are increasing, and this decrease in water quality  is  endangering  human  health  and  agricultural  yields  (very high  confidence)  (Section  3.4.2.4;  Table  3.26;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a; Bouderbala,  2019;  Rahman  et  al.,  2019;  Naser  et  al.,  2020;  Rakib 4613Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Serviceset  al.,  2020;  Mastrocicco  and  Colombani,  2021).  Coastal  salinisation is  attributed  to  regionally  varying  combinations  of  climate-induced drivers,  like  SLR  and  storm-related  flooding  by  seawater,  and  non-climate drivers, like water withdrawal and land-use changes (very high confidence) (Islam et al., 2019; Rahman et al., 2019; Paldor and Michael, 2021).  Monitoring-related  adaptations  (Section  3.6.2.2.2),  including advances in modelling and monitoring, are providing decision-relevant, regional-scale  information  (Colombani  et  al.,  2016;  Mukhopadhyay et  al.,  2019;  Slama  et  al.,  2020;  Corwin,  2021).  For  example,  new projections  indicate  which  drinking-water  intake  stations  on  China’s Pearl River Estuary will be unable to meet demands by 2100 due to SLR and drought (Wang and Hong, 2021), while others show that SLR effects on seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer in Kerala, India, under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are negligible (Sithara et al., 2020). Salinisation-associated changes may disproportionately burden women  responsible  for  securing  drinking  water  and  fuel,  such  as  in the Indian Sundarbans (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). Salinisation will continue to endanger coastal water and soil quality in the future (high confidence)  (Islam  et  al.,  2019;  Paldor  and  Michael,  2021),  but  the evidence  assessed  above  shows  that  subsequent  impacts  to  human health  and  agriculture  will  depend  heavily  on  regional  variations  in environment and human behaviour (medium confidence).Together,  climate-induced  and  non-climate  drivers  can  mobilise toxins  and  contaminants  in  ways  that  harm  human  and  marine species  health  (very  high  confidence)  (see  Box  3.2),  and  climate change  is  altering  these  relationships  (high  confidence)  (Table  3.26; Bindoff et al., 2019a). Under warming or ocean acidification, marine molluscs  exposed  to  pharmaceuticals  via  wastewater  experience more detrimental biological consequences or greater bioaccumulation (limited evidence, high agreement) (Costa et al., 2020a; Costa et al., 2020b; Dionísio et al., 2020; Freitas et al., 2020; Kibria et al., 2021). Physical  circulation,  temperature  and  biogeochemical  characteristics (Bowman et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020b; Sun et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b) control the ubiquitous oceanic distribution of methylmercury, and ocean acidification- and warming-driven changes in planktonic speciation and interactions can promote additional food-web  bioaccumulation  of  methylmercury  (Tada  and  Marumoto,  2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2021a). Interactions among  drivers  also  matter:  temperature  plus  overfishing  increased tissue  methylmercury  concentrations  in  Atlantic  bluefin  tuna  from the  1970s  to  the  2000s  more  than  the  decreases  in  the  late  1990s and 2000s from lower environmental mercury levels (Schartup et al., 2019). This appears true for persistent organic pollutants as well, but their bioaccumulation is related more to temperature effects on animal behaviour  than  on  pollutant  dynamics  (Houde  et  al.,  2019; Wagner et  al.,  2019;  Kalia  et  al.,  2021).  By  2100  under  RCP8.5,  productivity changes  and  community  structure  shifts  are  expected  to  increase methylmercury  concentrations  in  polar  oceans  and  high-latitude phytoplankton and decrease it in low latitudes (Zhang et al., 2021a). The estimated average global cost of mercury-related health effects by 2050,  mainly  from  seafood  consumption  during  2010–2050,  will  be 19 trillion USD (2020), assuming a 3% discount rate, if methylmercury emissions are not reduced (Zhang et al., 2021b).Since  previous  assessments,  evidence  has  increased  that  climate impacts, such as warming, extreme weather and SLR, are increasing the  geographic  spread  and  risk  of  marine-borne  human  pathogen outbreaks,  including  Vibrio  spp.  (very  high  confidence)  (Table  3.26; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Logar-Henderson et al., 2019; Froelich and Daines, 2020;  Montánchez  and  Kaberdin,  2020;  Semenza,  2020;  Ferchichi et  al.,  2021).  Climate  change  affects  at  least  30  human  pathogens with aquatic-system infection routes (e.g., ingestion of contaminated water  or  seafood,  or  contact  with  wounds;  Table  3.SM.2;  Cross-Chapter  Box  ILLNESS  in  Chapter  2;  Nichols  et  al.,  2018).  Conditions favourable for Vibrio cholerae are increasing globally, which raises the risk to humans (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2). Increased storm-related flooding and SLR further increase human encounters with Vibrio spp. (Froelich and Daines, 2020). Aquatic diseases, particularly Vibrio  spp.,  have  caused  large  economic  losses  in  aquaculture  by decreasing the quality or survival of cultured species (Lafferty et al., 2015; Novriadi, 2016). Temperature-based model projections show that all  Canadian  shellfish  beds  will  experience  conditions  that  promote high risk of Vibrio spp. growth by 2100 for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Ferchichi et al., 2021). Climate-induced drivers may increase Vibrio spp. loads in seafood species: laboratory-simulated heatwaves increase  Vibrio  spp.  abundance  in  Pacific  oyster  (Crassostrea  gigas) (Green et al., 2019) and simulated ocean acidification increases hard clam  (Mercenaria  mercenaria)  susceptibility  to  Vibrio  spp.  infection (Schwaner et al., 2020). Projected increases in temperature, extreme and variable rainfall conditions, coastal flooding and SLR (Section 3.2; Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3)  strongly  increase  the  risk  of frequent  and  severe  aquatic  human  pathogen  outbreaks  in  ocean and coastal areas that will continue to harm human health and cause economic  losses  (high  confidence)  (Cross-Chapter  Box  ILLNESS  in Chapter 2; Froelich and Daines, 2020; Semenza, 2020; Ferchichi et al., 2021). Section 3.6.3.1.5 assesses human adaptations to increasing risk of marine-borne pathogens.Climate-driven  changes  in  temperature,  salinity  (from  ice  melt  and precipitation  changes),  deoxygenation  and  ocean  acidification  can alter  dynamics  of  infectious  diseases  that  target  ocean  and  coastal species  by  increasing  hosts’  susceptibility  or  pathogens’  abundance or  virulence  (high  confidence)  (Burge  and  Hershberger,  2020;  Byers, 2021).  Coral  and  urchin  diseases  have  increased  over  time  driven by  warming-related  declines  in  organism  recovery  and  survival  or immunity (medium confidence) (Cohen et al., 2018; Tracy et al., 2019). Seagrass  and  sea  star  wasting  disease  outbreaks  have  occurred under  combinations  of  ocean  warming  or  MHWs  and  non-climate drivers  (e.g.,  eutrophication,  bottom  trawling),  but  attribution  of these outbreaks to specific drivers is still not resolved (Harvell et al., 2019; Jakobsson-Thor et al., 2020; Krause-Jensen et al., 2021). Disease outbreaks threaten marine biodiversity, species that create habitat or dampen wave action, and keystone species (Harvell and Lamb, 2020). Attributing  observed  changes  in  marine  disease  patterns  to  climate remains  extremely  difficult  owing  to  interacting  climate  and  non-climate  drivers  (Burge  and  Hershberger,  2020)  and  lack  of  baseline data (Tracy et al., 2019). Projected increases in the frequency, duration and intensity of warming events would reduce survival and recovery of some species from hot events, reduce immunity of other species to pathogens, extend poleward ranges of some pathogens and increase infection risk when host species congregate in scarce habitat (Cohen et al., 2018). Pathogens that target ocean and coastal organisms may themselves  be  sensitive  to  future  climate  conditions  or  subsequent 462Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3ecosystem  changes,  which  challenges  development  of  projections (Cohen et al., 2018; Burge and Hershberger, 2020).coastal  ecosystem  health  (high  confidence)  (Section  4.2.6.1;  Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2; Bindoff et al., 2019a).New examples have illustrated how toxic HABs interfere with regulating, provisioning (Section 3.5.3) and cultural ecosystem services (Section 3.5.6) in interconnected ways (limited evidence, high agreement). A massive toxic  Pseudo-nitzschia  spp.  bloom  in  2013–2016  along  the  USA West Coast  triggered  Dungeness  crab,  rock  crab  and  razor  clam  fishery closures to protect human consumers (Sections 3.6.2, 3.6.3.1.5; McCabe et al., 2016), and this disproportionately harmed fishers, especially small-vessel owners, and fishing-support service industries, primarily through lost revenue (Ritzman et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2019; Trainer et al., 2019; Jardine et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2020a). Toxic Alexandrium spp. blooms promoted by climate-driven coastal extremes (e.g., MHWs, stratification, runoff) in Tasmania, Australia, in 2012 and Chile in 2016 caused fish kills, shellfish product recalls, substantial economic losses, and human sickness and death (Trainer et al., 2019). The Chile event caused an estimated loss of  800  million  USD  in  the  farmed  salmon  industry  (Díaz  et  al.,  2019) and resulted in a series of large, long-lasting regional protests calling for national aid (Delgado et al., 2019). New evidence, however, suggests that the perceived global increase in harmful algal blooms results from better monitoring and more detrimental bloom impacts, rather than a climate-linked mechanism (Hallegraeff et al., 2021).Natural  and  engineered  systems  have  long  been  used  effectively to  manage  precipitation  and  wastewater  safely  (see  Box  4.5),  and maintaining  and  enhancing  them  is  a  key  nature-based  adaptation strategy for coastal communities (Section 3.6.2.3; Cross-Chapter Paper 2). Estimated values of water purification and stormwater management provided  by  coastal  ecosystems  are  in  the  hundreds  to  thousands of  USD  per  hectare  [e.g.,  272  Euro  per  0.01 km2  yr–1  from  the Mediterranean’s  sandy  coastline  (Hérivaux  et  al.,  2018);  1100–2800 USD  per  0.01 km2  yr–1  from  the  state  of  Maryland,  USA  (Campbell et al., 2020b); 600 USD per 0.01 km2 yr–1 in Zhuzhou City, China (Zhan et al., 2020)]. Both wild and cultured organisms also provide filtration services. Seagrasses’ ability to purify water is well recognised by coastal residents and ocean resource users in tropical and temperate locations (Ambo-Rappe et al., 2019; Quevedo et al., 2020; Heckwolf et al., 2021; McKenzie  et  al.,  2021a).  Globally,  aquacultured  shellfish  remove  an estimated 49,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 6000 tonnes of phosphorus from coastal waters, worth a potential 1.20 billion USD, and they may help improve existing engineered wastewater treatment systems (van der  Schatte  Olivier  et  al.,  2020).  Climate  change,  especially  episodic extreme rains and RSLR (Romero-Lankao et al., 2014), is challenging management and design of wastewater and stormwater systems (high confidence)  (Flood  and  Cahoon,  2011;  Trtanj  et  al.,  2016;  Hummel et al., 2018; Kirshen et al., 2018; Nazarnia et al., 2020; Reznik et al., 2020;  McKenzie  et  al.,  2021b)  and  the  integrity  of  coastal  landfills (Beaven et al., 2020). Without substantial adaptation that addresses projected wastewater management challenges and community needs (Section  4.2.6.1;  Kirshen  et  al.,  2018;  Kirchhoff  and  Watson,  2019; Kool et al., 2020; Nazarnia et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2021), coastal water quality in many areas will decrease because of more frequent or severe releases of untreated wastes (high confidence) (Flood and Cahoon,  2011;  Hummel  et  al.,  2018;  Hughes  et  al.,  2021;  McKenzie et al., 2021b), and this will have harmful consequences for human and 33.5.5.4 Regulation of Physical HazardsCoastal ecosystems physically protect people and property from storms and  flooding,  and  climate  change  threatens  this  protection  function (Figure  3.22;  Table  3.26).  Increasingly  detailed  models  show  how warm-water  coral  reefs  (Reguero  et  al.,  2019;  Storlazzi  et  al.,  2019; Reguero et al., 2021) mangroves (Blankespoor et al., 2017; Menéndez et  al.,  2020;  Trégarot  et  al.,  2021)  and  wetlands  (Sun  and  Carson, 2020) prevent billions of US dollars of direct and indirect damage to private and public property and shield millions of people from flooding each year. Protection by mangroves provides more economic benefits in  higher-income  nations  and  shields  more  people  in  lower-income nations  (Menéndez  et  al.,  2020).  Seagrasses  (James  et  al.,  2020; James et al., 2021), kelp (Morris et al., 2020b; Zhu, 2020), suspended shellfish aquaculture (Gentry et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a), oyster reefs (Chowdhury et al., 2019), coastal wetlands (Möller, 2019; Keimer et al., 2021) and sandy coastlines (Section 3.4.2.6) Hérivaux et al., 2018) also measurably decrease wave energy. Non-climate drivers [e.g., invasive species (James et al., 2020), sediment-supply changes (Ganju, 2019; Ladd et al., 2019; Ilia, 2020), erosion and storm damage (Mehvar et al., 2019; Bacopoulos  and  Clark,  2021)],  acting  together  with  climate-induced drivers  and  associated  impacts  [e.g.,  SLR  (Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in Chapter 3), changes in plant biodiversity (Section 3.5.2; Lee Smee, 2019; Silliman et al., 2019; Schoutens et al., 2020), MHWs (Section 3.4.3.7) and acidification (Section 3.4.2.1)], compromise physical protection by coastal ecosystems (very high confidence). (See Cross-Chapter Box SLR in  Chapter  3  and  Sections  3.6.3.1  and  3.6.3.2.2  for  assessment  of adaptations that address this ecosystem service.)3.5.5.5 Regulation of Carbon Cycling in Ocean and Coastal EcosystemsCurrent and future total carbon storage and cycling in the ocean are governed by past and future CO2 emissions trajectories (Table 3.26), but  regional  ocean  and  coastal  carbon  stocks  and  cycling  vary  over time and space due to processes being altered by climate, including ocean  circulation,  sea  ice  cover,  coastal  upwelling  and  thermal stratification  (Section  3.2.2.3);  ocean  primary  production  and  export (Sections  3.2.3,  3.4.4);  and  marine  ecosystem  biodiversity  (high confidence) (Section 3.5.2; Figure 3.22). Quantifying regional carbon fluxes and stocks is still challenging and relies on indirect measures (e.g.,  Fennel  et  al.,  2019;  Clay  et  al.,  2020),  especially  in  coastal ecosystems  where  drivers  interact.  Carbon  cycling  and  storage  co-occurs  with  other  regulating  services  such  as  habitat  provision, water-quality  maintenance  and  coastal  protection  (Ouyang  et  al., 2018),  particularly  in  vegetated  coastal  ecosystems  (see  Box  3.4). Adaptations to support regional carbon cycling and storage generally focus on area-based management and conservation (Section 3.6.3.2), but interventions to enhance ocean carbon storage are being explored for mitigation (WGIII AR6 Chapter 7).463Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox 3.4 | Blue Carbon EcosystemsClimate change and other anthropogenic drivers, including eutrophication, land-use changes and overexploitation, directly and indirectly threaten blue carbon ecosystems (Annex II: Glossary). Commonly considered blue carbon ecosystems include vegetated coastal ecosystems (Sections 3.4.2.3–3.4.2.5), whose mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds host rooted, vascular plants known to store large amounts of carbon for long periods and to be amenable to management (Lovelock and Duarte, 2019). Other ocean and coastal taxa, including rooted or floating macroalgae (e.g., non-vascular multicellular kelp or seaweed genera such as Macrocystis spp., Sargassum spp. or Laminaria spp. (Filbee-Dexter and Wernberg, 2020), phytoplankton and even pelagic fauna (e.g., finfish or whales; Chami et al., 2019), have also been proposed as blue carbon ecosystems. Terrestrial vascular-plant-derived material can also carry and store significant amounts of carbon in marine environments (Cragg et al., 2020). There is increasing evidence about the coverage and carbon content of macroalgal, planktonic and faunal taxa, but low agreement about their long-term carbon-storage potential and manageability (Alongi, 2018b; Wernberg and Filbee-Dexter, 2018; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019; Ortega et al., 2019; Pfister et al., 2019; Queirós et al., 2019; Filbee-Dexter et al., 2020a; Gallagher, 2020; Mariani et al., 2020; Thorhaug et al., 2020; van Son et al., 2020; Bach et al., 2021; Bayley et al., 2021; Cavanagh et al., 2021; Frontier et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Pedersen et al., 2021; Weigel and Pfister, 2021). This section focuses on the array of ecosystem services and adaptation opportunities provided by vegetated coastal blue carbon ecosystems, where consensus and evidence are most abundant. Mitigation potential of blue carbon ecosystems is assessed with land-based mitigation options in WGIII AR6 Section 7.4.3Carbon storage and burial in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows (see Table Box 3.4.1) help regulate ocean and coastal carbon cycling and may contribute to nature-based mitigation, although regional estimates vary widely based on climatic and edaphic conditions (WGIII AR6  Section  7.4).  In  addition,  coastal  vegetated  ecosystems  provide  substantial  and  interdependent  regulating,  provisioning and  cultural  ecosystem  services. These  services  include:  (a)  disproportionately  high  biodiversity  per  unit  area  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2021a); (b) abundant habitat (Section 3.5.5.1) and nurseries for aquatic, terrestrial, aerial and microbial species; (c) natural filtration of waste and stormwater runoff into the coastal ocean (Sections 3.5.5.3, 4.2.7; Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2); (d) coastal protection (Section 3.5.5.4; Ouyang et al., 2018; Quevedo et al., 2020); (e) food and natural materials (Sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4); and (f) support for tourism,  livelihoods  and  cultural  activities  (Section  3.5.6).  Global  estimates  of  services  provided  by  coastal  blue  carbon  ecosystems depend on the quality of available mapping, which is currently best developed for mangroves (Macreadie et al., 2019), and improving for salt marshes and seagrasses (McOwen et al., 2017; McKenzie et al., 2020; Young et al., 2021).Table Box 3.4.1 |  Estimates of organic carbon storage and burial rates in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadowsaMangrovesSalt marshesSeagrass meadowsCarbon stocks (MgC ha–1)856 ± 64.2 [79–2208] (Kauffman et al., 2020)317.2 ± 38.2 [27–1900] (Alongi, 2018c)Carbon burial rate (g C m–2 yr–1)194 ± 30 [6.2–1722] (Wang et al., 2020)168 ± 14 [1.2–1167.5] (Wang et al., 2020)139.7 [9.1–628] (Fourqurean et al., 2012; Alongi, 2018d)220.7 ± 40.2 [–2094 to 2124] (Alongi, 2018d)Global carbon burial rate (TgC yr–1)41 (Wang et al., 2020)12.63 (Wang et al., 2020)35.31 (Alongi, 2020)Global areal coverage (Mha)13.7 (Richards et al., 2020)5.5 (McOwen et al., 2017)16 (McKenzie et al., 2020)(a) Estimates are the mean ± 95% confidence interval, where available (indicating the extremely likely range) and range. Carbon stocks for mangroves include above- and below-ground storage up to 3 m depth (sampling period 2007–2017). The estimates for salt-marsh and seagrass stocks are soil stocks up to 1 m depth (observations spanning 1983–2016 for salt marshes and until 2016 for seagrass meadows). Date ranges for the burial rates are: 1989–2020, 1975–2020 and 1956–2016 for mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, respectively.Coastal vegetated ecosystems are vulnerable to harm from multiple climate-induced and non-climate drivers, and together these have reduced  wetland  area  globally  (high  confidence)  (Section  3.4.2.5)  and  endangered  the  services  provided  by  these  ecosystems  (high confidence). Loss of coastal vegetated ecosystems changes biodiversity (Sections 3.5.2, 3.4.2.3–3.4.2.5; Numbere, 2019; Parreira et al., 2021), increases risk of damage and erosion from SLR and storms (Sections 3.4.2.3–3.4.2.5; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Galeano et al., 2017) and impacts provisioning (Sections 3.5.3–3.5.4; Li et al., 2018b; Maina et al., 2021). These changes also strongly determine the  quantity  and  longevity  of  blue  carbon  storage  (high  confidence)  (Macreadie  et  al.,  2019;  Lovelock  and  Reef,  2020).  Specific  site characteristics and ecosystem responses to climate change will determine future local blue carbon storage or loss (high confidence) (see Table Box 3.4.2). For instance, poleward migration of mangroves to areas dominated by salt marshes is expected to increase carbon 464Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box 3.4 (continued)storage (Kelleway et al., 2016); however, this change in the dominant vegetation and associated faunal changes can modify carbon stocks and sequestration, as well as other ecosystem services (Martinetto et al., 2016; Kelleway et al., 2017; Smee et al., 2017; Macreadie et al., 2019; Macy et al., 2019). Landward range expansion of mangroves, marshes and seagrass in response to gradual RSLR can enhance carbon sequestration (Section 3.4.2.5; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Macreadie et al., 2019), but coastal squeeze can limit this (Phan et al., 2015; Schuerch et al., 2018) and RSLR can either submerge and bury or erode and release stored blue carbon (Section 3.4.2.5; Macreadie et al., 2019; Lovelock and Reef, 2020). Gains and losses of mangrove habitat area (and therefore carbon storage) projected for nations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 depend primarily on the combination of SLR rate, adaptation scenario (including coastal development) and island or continental status (Lovelock and Reef, 2020). The influence of warming, MHWs and acidification on seagrass meadows (Kendrick et al., 2019; Strydom et al., 2020), and associated coralligenous reefs (Zunino et al., 2019), suggests that future warming and especially MHWs will cause more widespread loss of services from these ecosystems (Section 3.4.2.5). Loss of blue carbon ecosystems will not only halt carbon storage but also release stored carbon: emissions after 2000 due to global mangrove deforestation have been estimated at 23.5–38.7 Tg Cyr–1 (Ouyang and Lee, 2020). Mitigation estimates for avoided conversion and restoration of coastal wetlands and the implications of the impacts of climate change are assessed in WGIII AR6 Section 7.4.To  date,  initiatives  aiming  to  restore  coastal  wetland  ecosystems  primarily  address  ecosystem  characteristics  other  than  carbon  storage (Herr et al., 2017; de los Santos et al., 2019; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019; Friess et al., 2020a). But recovery of coastal vegetated ecosystems is expected to bring back the full suite of ecosystem services they provide, not just carbon storage (medium confidence) (Marbà et al., 2015a; Burden et al., 2019; Friess et al., 2020a), making coastal restoration a low-risk action that offers both adaptation and mitigation benefits (Steven et al., 2020; Gattuso et al., 2021). Successful restoration requires using appropriate plant species in suitable environmental settings (Wodehouse and Rayment, 2019; Friess et al., 2020a) with favourable geomorphology and biophysical conditions (Cameron et al., 2019; Ochoa-Gómez et al., 2019) and considering social, economic, policy and operational constraints (Section 3.6.3.2.2; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2), now and in the future (high confidence) (Duarte et al., 2020; Lovelock and Reef, 2020). Nevertheless, restored spaces may not store carbon at rates equal to those of undisturbed spaces (Yang et al., 2020), and it may take decades to determine or achieve carbon-storage outcomes of restoration (Sasmito et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2020; Oreska et al., 2020). Integration improves efforts to restore or conserve coastal wetland ecosystems to accomplish both adaptation and mitigation outcomes (Steven et al., 2020). Government-led conservation of blue carbon ecosystems as part of national and subnational climate strategies (e.g., Friess et al., 2020a; Kelleway et al., 2020; Wedding et al., 2021) benefits from coordination with private activities, such as incentivising conservation with payments for ecosystem services (Muenzel and Martino, 2018; Friess et al., 2020a). Moreover, successful area-based protection measures consider both environmental and social issues (Section 3.6.3.2). Continued integration and alignment of policies at international to local levels (Section 3.6.5) will also support achieving the adaptation and mitigation benefit of blue carbon spaces (Friess et al., 2020a; Steven et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a).3Table Box 3.4.2 |  Examples of vegetated blue carbon ecosystem carbon-storage gains and losses in response to climate-induced drivers, and key actions contributing to maintained and/or increased carbon storageaMangrovesSalt marshesSeagrassesSea level riseLandward expansion by vegetationCoastal squeezeLoss of low-lying or submerged land or vegetationHuman adaptation to increase accommodation spaceExtreme stormsErosion, loss of area, subsidenceEnhanced sedimentation+C−C−C+C−C+CVegetation damage and mortality−C to +C+C−C−C+C−C+C+C−C−C0 to −C+C−C465Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services3Box 3.4 (continued)WarmingIncreased productivityVegetation mortalityIncreased decomposition of soilPoleward expansion of mangrovesPoleward expansion of seagrassesPoleward expansion of bioturbatorsChange in dominant speciesRising concentrations of atmospheric CO2Increased productivity of some speciesBiodiversity lossAltered precipitationVegetation mortalityReduced productivityIncreased productivityIncreased remineralisationLow-salinity eventsKey actions to sustain blue carbon storageProtect ecosystemsDevelop alternative livelihoodsProvide space for landward migrationRestore hydrological connectionsMaintain or restore sediment supplyRestore ecosystemsPlant indigenous speciesReduce nutrient inputs+C−C+C∆C∆C∆C−C−C+C−CXXXXXXMangrovesSalt marshesSeagrasses−C to +C−C∆C−C−CXXXXX+C−C+C+C−C+C0 to −CXXX(a) ‘+C’ indicates potential positive effects on blue carbon stocks, ‘−C’ indicates potential negative effects, ‘0’ indicates no effects and ‘∆C’ indicates positive potential or negative effects.

(2020) and Wedding et al. (2021).466Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 33.5.6 Cultural ServicesCultural services provided by ocean and coastal ecosystems help maintain psychological  well-being,  cultural  development,  human  identities, educational opportunities and reserves that could support development of future goods or activities (Table 3.25). Most recent studies of ocean and coastal cultural services simply detail local benefits using replicable methods (e.g., Drakou et al., 2018; Folkersen, 2018; Förster et al., 2019; Lau et al., 2019; Pouso et al., 2019; Weitzman, 2019; Yang et al., 2019), focusing  on  diverse  ocean  and  coastal  environments  and  ecosystems (Jobstvogt et al., 2014; Balzan et al., 2018; Drakou et al., 2018; Ingram et al., 2018; Pouso et al., 2018; Zapata et al., 2018; Ghermandi et al., 2019; Pouso et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2019; Ortíz Liñán and Vázquez Solís, 2021). Cultural ecosystem services may directly benefit from marine development activities, such as marine aquaculture (e.g., Alleway et al., 2018), and indirectly benefit from marine activities that increase biodiversity (e.g., Causon and Gill, 2018). Cultural services are  generally  quantified  using  interviews  and  revealed-preference  or stated-preference valuation (National Research Council, 2005; Sangha et  al.,  2019),  but  people  often  are  especially  reluctant  to  evaluate cultural ecosystem services in monetary terms, given the spiritual and community linkages to these services (Oleson et al., 2018).Additional evidence since previous assessments (Table 3.26) confirms that climate-change impacts on ocean and coastal cultural ecosystem services  have  already  disrupted  people’s  place-based  emotional attachments and cultural activities (limited evidence, high agreement) (Figure  3.22).  Bleaching  and  mortality  of  corals  in  the  Great  Barrier Reef have induced measurable ‘reef grief’, a type of solastalgia, among reef  visitors  and  researchers  (Conroy,  2019;  Curnock  et  al.,  2019; Marshall et al., 2019). The mental health of people in Tuvalu (Gibson et  al.,  2020), Alaska  (Allen,  2020)  and  Honduras  (Kent  and  Brondo, 2020)  have  suffered  from  both  the  experience  of  climate  impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems (e.g., SLR and changes in fisheries and wildlife), and the anticipation of more in the future. The climate-associated  MHWs  and  harmful  algal  bloom  events  in  2014–2016  in the US Pacific Northwest (Moore et al., 2019) prevented seasonal razor clam harvests culturally important to Indigenous Peoples and the local community (Section 3.5.5.3; Crosman et al., 2019). Sea level rise and storm-driven  coastal  erosion  endanger  coastal  archaeological  and heritage  sites  around  the  world  (very  high  confidence)  (Hoque  and Hoque, 2008; Carmichael et al., 2018; Reimann et al., 2018; Elliott and Williams,  2019;  Ravanelli  et  al.,  2019; Anzidei  et  al.,  2020;  Chemeli et al., 2020; García Sánchez et al., 2020; Harkin et al., 2020; Hil, 2020; Rivera-Collazo, 2020).Disruptions in ocean and coastal ecosystem services partly attributable to climate change have also caused economic losses (limited evidence, high  agreement).  Water-quality  deterioration  over  24  years  in  a temperate  bay  in  the  USA  due  to  nutrient  enrichment  and  warming caused  0.08–0.67  million  USD  per  decade  in  lost  recreational shellfish  revenues  (Luk  et  al.,  2019).  In  southwestern  Florida,  where nutrient  enrichment,  lake  hydrology,  and  rainfall  conditions  control cyanobacterial HAB formation (Havens et al., 2019), toxic HAB events deterred  visitors  and  recreation,  leading  to  lodging  and  restaurant revenue losses (Bechard, 2020), decreased domestic and international arrivals and overall visitor spending (a 99 million USD loss from August to October 2018; Scanlon, 2019), and lost recreational spending from loss  of  boat-ramp  access  (a  3  million  USD  economic  loss  from  June to September 2018; Alvarez et al., 2019). In Cornwall, England, HABs from  2009  to  2016  disrupted  residents’  sense  of  place,  identity  and well-being  by  interrupting  recreational  and  economic  activities,  and by  creating  feelings  of  uncertainty  and  unease  around  the  safety  or dependability  of  future  ocean-related  activities  (Willis  et  al.,  2018). Increasingly  abundant  Sargassum  spp.  floating  macroalgae  from  the central Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, whose proliferation has been attributed  to  high  sea  surface  temperatures  and  nutrient  enrichment (Wang et al., 2019a), has substantially disrupted beach tourism in the Caribbean and Mexico and imposes millions of dollars of clean-up costs annually on affected beaches (Milledge and Harvey, 2016).Observed disruption of ocean and coastal cultural services by climate impacts,  plus  increasingly  severe  and  widespread  projected  climate-change impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems, imply that the risk to cultural ecosystem services will remain constant or even increase (medium confidence) (Figure 3.22; Table 3.26). Recent studies assert that cultural ecosystem services are at risk from climate change (high confidence) (Singh et al., 2019a; Koenigstein, 2020). However, limited evidence and complex social–ecological interactions (e.g., Ingram et al., 2018) challenge development of specific projections. For instance, the little auk (Alle alle) in the North Water Polynya is traditionally harvested by Indigenous Inughuit for food and community-wide celebrations and seasonal  activities,  but  harvests  are  threatened  to  an  undetermined degree  as  the  seabird  competes  for  food  with  recovering  bowhead whale  (Balaena  mysticetus)  populations  and  northward  range  shifts of capelin (Mallotus villosus) due to warming (Mosbech et al., 2018). Section 3.6 assesses the cultural implications of implemented human adaptations.3.6 Planned Adaptation and Governance to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals3.6.1 IntroductionHuman adaptation comprises an array of measures (adaptation options; IPCC, 2014a) that modulate harm or exploit opportunities from climate change  (Section  1.2.1.3).  Adaptation  options  that  respond  to  key ocean and coastal risks (Section 3.4) focus on individuals, livelihoods and economic sectors that benefit from ocean and coastal ecosystem services (Section 3.5). AR5 concluded that local adaptation measures would  not  alone  be  enough  to  offset  global  effects  of  increased climate change on marine and coastal ecosystems, and that mitigation of emissions would also be necessary (high confidence) (Table 3.27; Pörtner  et  al.,  2014;  Oppenheimer  et  al.,  2019).  SROCC  assessed that  ecosystem-based  adaptation,  including  MPAs  (high  confidence) (Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a)  and  adaptive  management,  are  effective  to reduce  climate-change  impacts  (IPCC,  2018;  IPCC,  2019b),  but  that existing  marine  governance  is  insufficient  to  provide  an  effective adaptation response in the marine ecosystem (high confidence) (IPCC, 2019c).3467Assessment’scorrespondingsection inthe report3.5.23.5.33.5.43.5.5.13.5.5.23.5.5.33.5.5.43.5.5.5Box 3.43.5.63Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesObserved global influence of climate-induced drivers on ecosystem servicesEcosystem service WarmingBiodiversityFood provisionOther provisioningHabitat creation and maintenanceClimate and air qualityRegulation of water quality/pathogensRegulation of physical hazardsOcean carbon storageBlue carbon storageCultural servicesClimate-induced driversMarineheat-wavesOceanacidification/atmosphericCO2Sea-levelriseStormsOxygenlossSeaicelossBiodiversitylossObservedimpactPrimary non-climate driversnoitadargedtatibaHnoitullopeniraM/seirehsFignitsevrah-netneirtuNtnemecnahsuonegdniiiseceps-noNnanananananananananananana/nananananananananananana/Strength of impactConfidence levelPositiveMixeddirectionNegativeLowLowMediumMediumHighHigh/= not applicablena= no data or not assessedFigure 3.22 |  Observed global influence of climate-induced drivers on ecosystem services. Symbols show whether the observed impact of the climate-induced drivers on a group of ecosystem services is positive (beneficial), negative (detrimental) or mixed (usually resulting from location, the presence of interacting drivers or changing effects over time). The ‘observed impact’ indicates the total effect of all climate-induced drivers on a specific ecosystem service, using expert judgement based on summary statements throughout Section 3.5.  Tick marks represent the presence of co-occurring drivers non-climate drivers that affect the service. No assessment indicates that not enough evidence is available to assess the direction of impact.This  section  builds  on  the  SROCC  assessment  of  the  portfolio of  available  solutions,  their  applicability  and  their  effectiveness in  reducing  climate-change-induced  risks  to  ocean  and  coastal ecosystems.  Section  3.6.2  assesses  the  set  of  planned  adaptation measures.  Section  3.6.3  assesses  implementation  of  adaptation solutions and the enablers, barriers and limitations that affect their feasibility.  Section  3.6.4  evaluates  the  contribution  of  planned adaptation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other policy-relevant  frameworks,  and  Section  3.6.5  synthesises  emerging evidence about best practices.3.6.2 Adaptation SolutionsAdaptation in ocean and coastal ecosystems continues to be informed primarily by theory, as there is still limited evidence about implemented solutions  (high  agreement)  (Seddon  et  al.,  2020)  and  their  success across  regions,  especially  in  low-income  nations  (Chausson  et  al., 2020). Adapting  to  climate  change  depends  on  society’s  ability  and willingness  to  anticipate  the  change,  recognise  its  effects,  plan  to accommodate its consequences (Ling and Hobday, 2019; Wilson et al., 2020b) and implement a coordinated portfolio of informed solutions. Here, the complete portfolio of adaptation solutions is assessed using the taxonomy of Abram et al. (2019): (1) socio-institutional adaptation, (2)  built  infrastructure  and  technology,  and  (3)  marine  and  coastal nature-based solutions (NbS) (Figure 3.23).3.6.2.1 Socio-Institutional AdaptationIncreasing evidence shows that an effective solution portfolio includes social and institutional adaptation (Figure 3.23, top; Table 3.28). Social adaptation  to  climate  change  is  already  occurring,  as  people  use strategies ranging from accommodating change, to coping, adapting and  transforming  their  livelihoods  (Béné  and  Doyen,  2018;  Fedele et al., 2019; Galappaththi et al., 2019; Barnes et al., 2020; Ojea et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021c). Although management and institutions have major roles in adaptation (Gaines et al., 2018; Barange, 2019), marine governance  is  impeded  by  increasing  numbers  of  often-competing users and uses (Boyes and Elliott, 2014); sector-led, fragmented efforts (Nunan et al., 2020); and a legal framework less clear than those on land (Crespo et al., 2019; Guggisberg, 2019). Future social responses depend  on  warming  levels  and  on  the  institutional,  socioeconomic and cultural constructs that allow or limit livelihood changes (medium confidence) (Chapter 18; Galappaththi et al., 2019; Ford et al., 2020; Green  et  al.,  2021c).  Both  social  and  institutional  transformations are  needed  to  change  the  structures  of  power,  culture,  politics  and/or identity associated with marine ecosystems (Section 1.5.2; Wilson et  al.,  2020b).  Ideally,  institutional  and  social  adaptation  will  work together  to  sustain  knowledge  systems  and  education,  enhance participation  and  social  inclusion,  facilitate  livelihood  support  and transformational  change  of  dependent  coastal  communities,  provide economic and financial instruments, and include polycentric and multi-level governance of transboundary management (Fedele et al., 2019; Fulton et al., 2019).468 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 3.4 | Which industries and jobs are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the oceans?The global ocean underpins human well-being through the provision of resources that directly and indirectly feed and employ many millions of people. In many regions, climate change is degrading ocean health and altering stocks of marine resources. Together with over-harvesting, climate  change  is  threatening  the  future  of  the  sustenance  provided  to  Indigenous  Peoples,  the  livelihoods  of  artisanal  fisheries,  and marine-based industries including tourism, shipping and transportation.The  ocean  is  the  lifeblood  of  the  planet.  In  addition  to  regulating  planetary  cycles  of  carbon,  water  and  heat, the  ocean  and  its  vast  resources  support  human  livelihoods,  cultural  practices,  jobs  and  industries.  The  impacts of climate change on the ocean can influence human activities and employment by altering resource availability, spreading  pathogens,  flooding  shorelines  and  degrading  ocean  ecosystems.  Fishing  and  mariculture  are  highly exposed  to  change.  The  global  ocean  and  inland  waters  together  provide  more  than  3.3  billion  people  at  least 20% of the protein they eat and provide livelihoods for 60 million people. Changes in the nutritional quality or abundance of food from the oceans could influence billions of people.Substantial  economic  losses  for  fisheries  resulting  from  recent  climate-driven  harmful  algal  blooms  and  marine pathogen outbreaks have been recorded in Asia, North America and South America. A 2016 event in Chile caused an estimated loss of 800 million USD in the farmed-salmon industry and led to regional government protests. The recent closure of the Dungeness crab and razor clam fishery in the USA due to a climate-driven algal bloom harmed 84%  of  surveyed  residents  from  16  California  coastal  communities.  Fishers  and  service  industries  that  support commercial and recreational fishing experienced the most substantial economic losses, and fishers were the least able  to  recover  their  losses.  This  same  event  also  disrupted  subsistence  and  recreational  fishing  for  razor  clams, important activities for Indigenous Peoples and local communities in the Pacific Northwest of the USA.3Other goods from the ocean, including non-food products like dietary supplements, food preservatives, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, sponges and cosmetic products, as well as luxury products like jewellery coral, cultured pearls and aquarium species, will change in abundance or quality due to climate change. For instance, ocean warming is endangering the ‘candlefish’ ooligan (Thaleichthys pacificus), whose oil is a traditional food source and medicine of Indigenous Peoples of the Pacific Northwest of North America. Declines in tourism and real estate values, associated with climate-driven harmful algal blooms, have also been recorded in the USA, France and England.Small-scale  fisheries  livelihoods  and  jobs  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  climate-driven  changes  in  marine  resources  and ecosystem services. The abundance and composition of their harvest depend on suitable environmental conditions and on IKLK developed over generations. Large-scale fisheries, though still vulnerable, are more able to adapt to climate change due to greater mobility and greater resources for changing technologies. These fisheries are already adapting by broadening catch diversity, increasing their mobility to follow shifting species, and changing gear, technology and strategies. Adaptation in large-scale fisheries, however, is at times constrained by regulations and governance challenges.Jobs, industries and livelihoods which depend on particular species or are tied to the coast can also be at risk from climate change. Species-dependent livelihoods (e.g., a lobster fishery or oyster farm) are vulnerable due to a lack of  substitutes  if  the  fished  species  are  declining,  biodiversity  is  reduced,  or  mariculture  is  threatened  by  climate change or ocean acidification. Coastal activities and industries ranging from fishing (e.g., gleaning on a tidal flat) to tourism to shipping and transportation are also vulnerable to sea level rise and other climate-change impacts on the coastal environment. The ability of coastal systems to protect the shoreline will decline due to sea level rise and simultaneous degradation of nearshore systems, including coral reefs, kelp forests and coastal wetlands.The  vulnerability  of  communities  to  losses  in  marine  ecosystem  services  varies  within  and  among  communities. Tourists seeking to replace lost cultural services can adapt by engaging in the activity elsewhere. But communities who  depend  on  tourism  for  income  or  who  have  strong  cultural  identity  linked  to  the  ocean  have  a  more difficult time. Furthermore, climate-change impacts exacerbate existing inequalities already experienced by some communities, including Indigenous Peoples, Pacific Island countries and territories and marginalised peoples, such as migrants and women in fisheries and mariculture. These inequities increase the risk to their fundamental human rights  by  disrupting  livelihoods  and  food  security,  while  leading  to  loss  of  social,  economic  and  cultural  rights. These maladaptive outcomes can be avoided by securing tenure and access rights to resources and territories for all people depending on the ocean, and by supporting decision-making processes that are just, participatory and equitable.469Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesBox FAQ 3.4 (continued)Which livelihoods and economic sectors are most vulnerable to the impactsof climate change in the oceans?Vulnerabilityvery highhighmedium/lowsrotceSssssdoohileviLsecivresmetsysocEsmetsySsdrazaHCoastal populationSmall-scale fisheriesMaricultureTourismBlue energyLarge-scale fisheriesMaritime transportationSmall scale fishers and shellfish gatherersSmall island developing statesIndigenous PeoplesCultural–physical and psychological well beingCultural–recreationCultural–supporting identitiesProvisioning–fiber and foodProvisioning–medicinal and option valueProvisioning–fisheriesRegulation of hazardsRegulationof sedimentsRegulation of salinityRegulationof freshwaterRegulationof OARegulationof climateRegulation ofair qualitySupportingHabitat creationSupportingdispersalRegulation of fl tiRair qualityRegulation of freshwaterRRegReg llaulatitiotion on offfRegulation of climateRegulation of salinitySupporting-dispersal123Regulation of hazardsSupporting-Habitatcreation123Regulationof sediments4213214Regulation of OA212342444121pH234O2Ocean acidificationOcean warmingSea level riseDeoxygenationFigure FAQ3.4.1 |  Illustration of vulnerable ocean and coastal groups, the climate-induced hazards they experience, and anticipated outcomes for human systems.3470 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box FAQ 3.4 (continued)A key adaptation solution is improving access to credit and insurance in order to buffer against variability in resource access and abundance. Further actions that decrease social and institutional vulnerability are also important, such as inclusive decision-making processes, access to resources and land for Indigenous Peoples, and participatory approaches in management. For the fishing industry, international fisheries agreements and investing in sustainable mariculture and fisheries reforms is often recommended. Immediate adaptations to other challenges, such as harmful algal blooms, frequently include fishing-area closures; these can be informed by early-warning forecasts, public communications; and education. These types of adaptations are more effective when built on trusted relationships and effective coordination among involved parties, and are inclusive of the diversity of actors in a coastal community.Table 3.27 |  Conclusions from previous IPCC assessments about implemented adaptation, enablers and limits, and contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)AR5SR15SROCCDegree of implementation (Section 3.6.3.1)Conservation and restoration(Section 3.6.3.2)‘The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation towards climate-resilient and sustainable coasts has progressed moresignificantly in developed countries than in developing countries (high confidence)’(Wong et al., 2014).‘With continuing climate change, local adaptation measures (such as conservation) or a reduction in human activities (such asfishing) may not sufficiently offset global-scale effects on marine ecosystems (high confidence)’(Pörtner et al., 2014).‘Adaptation (to SLR) isalready happening (high confidence) and will remain important overmulti-centennial time scales’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).‘Existing and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be effective in reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).Enablers, barriers and limits of adaptation (Section 3.6.3.3)‘Adaptation strategies for ocean regions beyond coastal waters are generally poorly developed but will benefit from international legislation and expert networks, as well as marine spatial planning (high agreement)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).‘Lower rates of change [associated with a 1.5°C temperature increase] enhance the ability of natural and human systems to adapt, with substantial benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, wetland, coastal and ocean ecosystems (including coral reefs) (high confidence)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).SDGs and other policy frameworks (Section 3.6.4)‘Overall, there is a strong need to develop ecosystem-based monitoring and adaptation strategies to mitigate rapidly growing risks and uncertainties to the coastal and oceanic industries, communities and nations (high agreement)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).‘Adaptation strategies can result in trade-offs with and among the SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement)’(Roy et al., 2018).3‘A diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts and risks have been implemented around the world, but mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced disasters (high confidence)’(Oppenheimer et al., 2019).‘Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks (medium confidence) but at relatively high cost and effectiveness limited to low-emissions scenarios and to less-sensitive ecosystems (high confidence)’(Bindoff et al., 2019a).‘There are a broad range of identified barriers and limitsfor adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human systems (high confidence).

Migration could be considered an adaptation solution for some coastal and island populations in the cases of extreme events, but also as a response to more gradual changes (e.g., coastal erosion from sea level rise).Disaster response programmes confer resilience to communities and contribute to adaptation, when designed to be inclusive, participatory and adaptive.The multi-scale nature of ocean and coastal climate-change risk demands adaptation solutions at multiple levels of governance that consider the objectives and perceptions of all stakeholders to support local implementation of broad strategies.Institutional agreements for the management of transboundary marine resources are key for a sustainable future given current impacts on marine species distribution due to climate change.(a) Confidence is assessed in SM3.5.1.

Built  infrastructure  includes  engineered  solutions  that protect, accommodate or relocate coastal assets using hard engineering, like seawalls, and soft engineering, such as beach and shore nourishment (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3). Technological tools include early-warning systems for extreme events (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Collins et al., 2019a),  improved  forecast  and  hindcast  models  (Winter  et  al.,  2020; Davidson  et  al.,  2021;  Spillman  and  Smith,  2021)  and  environmental monitoring  (Claudet  et  al.,  2020a;  Wilson  et  al.,  2020a;  Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021) that support informed decision making (Tommasi et  al.,  2017;  Rilov  et  al.,  2020;  A.  Maureaud  et  al.,  2021).  Emerging adaptation technologies, such as habitat development, active restoration and assisted  evolution (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021),  intend  to  accelerate  recovery  of  damaged  ecosystems  and promote ecological adaptation to climate change (Jones et al., 2018a; Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021).The  ocean  and  coastal  adaptation  portfolio  (Figure  3.23)  also includes  marine  and  coastal  NbS  (Table  3.30).  NbS  that  contribute to climate adaptation, also known as ecosystem-based adaptations (EBA), are cross-cutting actions that harness ecosystem functions to restore,  protect  and  sustainably  manage  marine  ecosystems  facing climate-change  impacts,  while  also  benefiting  social  systems  and human  security  (Abelson  et  al.,  2015;  Barkdull  and  Harris,  2019) and  supporting  biodiversity  (high  confidence)  (Annex  II:  Glossary; Cross-Chapter  Box  NATURAL  in  Chapter  2;  Seddon  et  al.,  2021). NbS are expected to contribute to global adaptation and mitigation goals  (high  confidence)  (Beck  et  al.,  2018;  Cooley  et  al.,  2019; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b; Menéndez et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020a)  by  protecting  coastal  environments  from  SLR  and  storms (Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR;  Reguero  et  al.,  2018),  and  by  storing substantial  quantities  of  carbon  (Sections  3.4.2.5,  3.6.3.1.5; WGIII AR6 Chapter 7; Howard et al., 2017; Chow, 2018; Smale et al., 2018; Table 3.29 |  Assessment of built infrastructure and technology solutions to reduce mid-term climate impacts in oceans and coastal ecosystemsa3SolutionConfidence in solution (mid-term potential)Contribution to adaptationSelected referencesExamples of implementa-tionAccommodation and relocationHigh confidenceAsset modification and relocation of livelihoods to adapt to sea level rise, extreme events and coastal erosion.Hanson and Nicholls (2020); Monios and Wilmsmeier (2020); Zickgraf (2021)Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3, coastal development (Section 3.6.3.1.1)Protection and beach and shore nourishmentMedium confidenceEarly-warning systemsHigh confidenceSeasonal and dynamic forecastsHigh confidenceMonitoring systemsMedium confidenceHabitat developmentLow confidenceActive restorationHigh confidenceAssisted evolutionHigh confidenceProtection of coastal ecosystems with interventions, such as beach and shore nourishment, is a common response to beach erosion around the world, and an alternative to hard protection structures such as seawalls.Early-warning systems can support decision making, limit economic losses from extreme events and aid in the enterprise and development of adaptive management systems.The proliferation of real-time and seasonal forecasts of temperature extremes, marine heatwaves, storm surges, harmful algal blooms and the distribution of living marine resources greatly contribute to adaptation through monitoring, early-warning systems, adaptive management and ecosystem-based management.Monitoring systems that address climate-induced drivers, ecosystem impacts and social vulnerabilities in marine social–ecological systems are key for adaptation.Accelerates the recovery of damaged ecosystems and promotes ecological or biological adaptation to future climate change.Reintroduces species or augments existing populations, for example, propagating and transplanting heat-tolerant coral species.Manipulates species’ genes to accelerate natural selection.Pinto et al.

The  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  these  adaptations  are  assessed in Figure 3.24.introduced 3.6.3.1  Degree of Implementation and Evidence of Effectiveness Across Sectors3.6.3.1.1  Coastal community development and settlementCoastal adaptation often addresses the risk of flooding and erosion from SLR, changes in storm activity and degradation of coastal ecosystems and their services (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.2, 3.5; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Without coastal protection, people and property will be increasingly exposed to coastal flooding after 2050, especially under RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Bevacqua et al., 2020; Kirezci  et  al.,  2020). This  section  assesses  adaptation  responses  for coastal  ecosystems,  addressing  loss  of  natural  coastal  protection (Sections  3.4.2.1,  3.4.2.4–3.4.2.6),  and  the  need  for  relocation (Section 3.6.2.1.2). Adaptation responses specific to SLR are assessed in detail in Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3, while adaptation in coastal cities and settlements is assessed in Chapter 6.Table 3.30 |  Assessment of marine and coastal nature-based solutions to reduce mid-term climate impacts in oceans and coastal ecosystemsaSolutionConfidence in solution (mid-term potential)Contribution to adaptationSelected referencesHabitat restorationHigh confidenceMarine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs)High confidenceConservation of climate refugiaMedium confidenceTransboundary marine spatial planning (MSP) and integrated coastal zone management (ICZM)Low confidenceSustainable harvestingHigh confidenceClimate-adaptive managementHigh confidenceEcosystem-based management (EbM)High confidenceMarine habitat restoration increases biodiversity and protects shorelines and coastal livelihoods from climate oceanic hazards.Colls et al.

It also facilitates consideration of species distribution shifts and other climate-change responses.EbM focuses on ecosystems. By incorporating many of the above tools, ecosystem-based adaptation benefits adaptation of marine ecosystems and supports provision of ecosystem services to people.Gattuso et al.

Feasibility and effectiveness are assessed in Figure 3.24.475Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesCoastal conservation tends to involve cost-effective, low-impact actions that aim to support both adaptation and mitigation by conserving a wide array of ecosystem functions and services (Gattuso et al., 2018; Gattuso et al., 2021), and that are achievable by nations with extensive coastlines  or  low-income  status  (Herr  et  al.,  2017;  Taillardat  et  al., 2018). Where coastlines are undeveloped, the lowest-risk option is to avoid new development, but elsewhere, coastal conservation includes protection of key assets, accommodation of SLR, advancing defences seawards  or  upwards,  or  planned  retreat  from  the  coast  (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3).Hard-engineered  structures  like  seawalls  are  generally  more  costly than  nature-based  adaptations  (high  confidence)  (Hérivaux  et  al., 2018;  Haasnoot  et  al.,  2019;  Nicholls  et  al.,  2019;  Oppenheimer et al., 2019) and can lock communities into engineered responses in the  future  (Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3),  creating  trade-offs with mitigation goals, which constitutes maladaptation (Nunn et al., 2021)  that  carries  ecological  and  cultural  costs  (Sections  3.4.2.4, 3.4.2.6, 3.5.6). As a result, there is high agreement on the importance of  shifting  from  hard  infrastructure  to  soft  infrastructure  for  coastal defence (Toimil et al., 2020; Nunn et al., 2021). The common remedy for beach erosion is beach nourishment (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Pinto et al., 2020; Elko et al., 2021), which provides rapid results but poorly quantified trade-offs between efficacy, long-term cost, utility to beach users and ecological damage (de Schipper et al., 2021).regimes  develop  around  human  rights,  migration  (Scobie,  2019a), displacement  (George  Puthucherril,  2012)  and  the  implications  for national sovereignty (Yamamoto and Esteban, 2014) of disappearing land spaces caused by climate change. Colonial power dynamics can influence climate-change responses (Chapter 18), for example, when external funders favour migration over local desires to adapt in place to  preserve  national  identity  and  sovereignty  (Bordner  et  al.,  2020). Examples of relocation within livelihoods’ customary land show some successes (Section 15.3.4.6).Evidence  since  SROCC  (Section,  5.5.2.3.3;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a) continues to show that built infrastructure cannot address all of the adaptation challenges that coastal communities face. Coastal squeeze creates tensions between coastal development, armouring and habitat management  (Sections  3.4.2.4–3.4.2.6).  Managed  realignment  is the  best  option  to  reduce  risks  from  SLR  (high  confidence)  (Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3)  but  requires  transformative  changes in  coastal  development  and  settlement  (Felipe  Pérez  and  Tomaselli, 2021; Fitton et al., 2021; Mach and Siders, 2021; Siders et al., 2021). Implementation  of  protective  measures  varies  among  nations  and lack  of  financial  resources  limits  the  options  available  (very  high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Hinkel et al., 2018; Klöck and Nunn, 2019).3.6.3.1.2  Fisheries and mariculture3Since SROCC, coastal adaptation using NbS, like restoration of coastal vegetation,  has  advanced  substantially  (Cohen-Shacham  et  al.,  2019; Kuhl  et  al.,  2020;  Kumar  et  al.,  2020;  Morris  et  al.,  2020a).  Field  and modelling  studies  confirm  that  wetland  restoration  and  preservation are  key  actions  to  restore  coastal  protection  and  reduce  community vulnerability  to  flooding  (very  high  confidence)  (see  also  Section  3.6; Chapter  15;  Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3;  Jones  et  al.,  2020; Menéndez et al., 2020; Van Coppenolle and Temmerman, 2020), while maintaining  coastal  ecosystem  services  (Section  3.5).  Restoring  coral reefs,  oyster  reefs  and  mangroves  (Section  3.6.2.1)  and  protecting macrophyte  meadows  dissipates  wave  energy  (Section  3.4.2.1; Yates et  al.,  2017;  Beck  et  al.,  2018; Wiberg  et  al.,  2019;  Menéndez  et  al., 2020),  accretes  sediment  and  elevate  shorelines,  which  reduces exposure  to  waves  and  storm  surges,  and  offsets  erosional  losses (medium  confidence)  (Kench  and  Mann,  2017;  Pomeroy  et  al.,  2018; Dasgupta et al., 2019; James et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019; David and Schlurmann, 2020; Masselink et al., 2020). However, irreversible regime shifts in ocean ecosystems due to SLR and extreme events, such as MHWs, can limit or compromise restoration in the long term (high confidence) (Section 3.4.3.3.3; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Marzloff et al., 2016;  Johnson  et  al.,  2017a).  Under  all  warming  scenarios,  coastal wetlands  will  be  impacted  by  warming  and  MHWs  (Sections  3.2.2.1, 3.2.4.5;  Cross-Chapter  Box  9.1  in WGI  Chapter  9;  Fox-Kemper  et  al., 2021), while also being pressed inland by RSLR (Section 3.4.2.5; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3). Therefore, restoration and conservation are more successful when non-climate drivers are also minimised (high confidence) (Brodie et al., 2020; Duarte et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021).For  highly  exposed  human  settlements,  migration  is  an  adaptation option (e.g., for some island populations under extreme circumstances), but there are important uncertainties (Section 15.3.4.6), as international SROCC  (Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a)  assessed  adaptation  in  fisheries  and mariculture  (marine  aquaculture),  and  socioeconomically  focused updates are provided in Section 5.8.4 and Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5. Here, we present a brief synthesis of how fisheries and  mariculture  adaptations  interact  with  the  natural  environment, with further detail and supporting material in SM3.5.2.Mobility allows fishing fleets and fishers to adapt to shifts in marine species distributions (high agreement) (Sections 3.4.3.1, 3.5.3; Peck and  Pinnegar,  2018;  Pinsky  et  al.,  2018;  Frazão  Santos  et  al.,  2020) but  with  limits  and  unintended  consequences  (Pinsky  and  Fogarty, 2012;  Bell  et  al.,  2021).  Diversification  of  target  species,  harvest tactics  and  employment  sectors,  including  transitions  from  fisheries to mariculture and ecotourism, allows some fishers to accommodate some impacts on their livelihoods (Miller et al., 2018; Robinson et al., 2020;  Gonzalez-Mon  et  al.,  2021).  Technology  and  infrastructure adaptations  can  improve  marine  harvest  efficiency,  reduce  risk  and support resource management goals (Friedman et al., 2020; Bell et al., 2021; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021), but their ability to overcome climate-change  impacts  remains  uncertain  (Bell  et  al.,  2020). Improving  capacity  to  predict  anomalous  conditions  in  coastal  and marine  ecosystems  (Jacox  et  al.,  2019;  Holbrook  et  al.,  2020;  Jacox et al., 2020), storm-driven flooding in reef-lined coasts (Scott et al., 2020; Winter  et  al.,  2020)  and  fisheries  stocks  (Payne  et  al.,  2017; Tommasi  et  al.,  2017;  Muhling  et  al.,  2018)  can  improve  forecasts of  coastal  and  marine  resources;  these  can  enhance  sustainability of  wild-capture  fisheries  under  climate  change  (high  confidence) (Blanchard  et  al.,  2017; Tommasi  et  al.,  2017;  Pinsky  et  al.,  2020a; Bell  et  al.,  2021).  Limiting  overexploitation  is  the  central  goal  of fishery  management,  and  it  very  likely  benefits  fisheries  adaptation to climate change (Burden and Fujita, 2019; Free et al., 2019; Sumaila 476Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Cross-Chapter Box SLR | Sea Level RiseAuthors:  Gonéri  Le  Cozannet  (France,  Chapter  13,  CCP4),  Judy  Lawrence  (New  Zealand,  Chapter  11),  David  S.

Ultimately, it threatens the existence of cities and settlements in low-lying areas, and some island nations and their cultural heritage (Chapters 9–15; Cross-Chapter Papers 2, 4; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). The challenge can be addressed by mitigation of climate change and coastal adaptation.Current impacts of sea level riseThe rate of global mean SLR was 1.35 mm yr–1 (0.78–1.92 mm yr–1, very likely range) during 1901–1990, faster than during any century in at least 3000 years (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Stanley and Warne, 1994; Woodroffe et al., 2016; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Global mean SLR has accelerated to 3.25 mm yr–1 (2.88–3.61 mm yr–1, very likely range) during 1993–2018 (high confidence). Extreme sea levels have increased consistently across most regions (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). The largest observed changes in coastal ecosystems are being caused by the concurrence of human activities, waves, current-induced sediment transport and extreme storm events (medium confidence) (Chapters 3, 15, 16; Takayabu et al., 2015; Mentaschi et al., 2018; Duvat, 2019; Murray et al., 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Early impacts of accelerating SLR detected at sheltered or subsiding coasts include chronic flooding at high tides, wetland salinisation and ecosystem transitions, increased erosion and coastal flood damage (Chapters 3, 11, 13–16; WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Sweet and Park, 2014; Moftakhari et al., 2015; Nunn et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Sharples et al., 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Strauss et al., 2021). The exposure of many coastal populations and ecosystems to SLR is high: economic development is disproportionately concentrated in and around coastal cities and settlements (virtually certain) (Chapters 3, 9–15; Cross-Chapter Papers 2, 4).3Projected risks to coastal communities, infrastructure and ecosystemsRisks from SLR are very likely to increase by one order of magnitude well before 2100 without adaptation and mitigation action as agreed by parties to the Paris Agreement (very high confidence). Global mean SLR is likely to continue accelerating under SSP1-2.6 and more strongly forced scenarios (Figure BoxSLR1; WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), increasing the risk of chronic coastal flooding at high tide, serious flooding during extreme events such as swells, storms and hurricanes, and erosion, and coastal ecosystem losses across many low-lying and erodible coasts (very high confidence) (Chapters 3, 9–15; Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Hinkel et al., 2014; McLachlan and Defeo, 2018; Kulp and Strauss, 2019; Vousdoukas et al., 2020b). The compounding of rainfall, river flooding, rising water tables, coastal surges and waves are projected to exacerbate SLR impacts on low-lying areas and rivers further inland (Chapters 4, 11–15; Bevacqua et al., 2020).There is high confidence that coastal risks will increase by at least one order of magnitude over the 21st century due to committed SLR (Hinkel et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2014; IPCC, 2019b). Exposure of population and economic assets to coastal hazards is projected to increase over the next decades, particularly in coastal regions with fast-growing populations in Africa, Southeast Asia and Small Islands (medium evidence) (Chapters 9–15; Cross-Chapter Papers 2, 4; Neumann et al., 2015; Jones and O’Neill, 2016; Merkens et al., 2016; Merkens et al., 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2020). For RCP8.5, 2.5–9% of the global population and 12–20% of the global gross domestic product is projected to be exposed to coastal flooding by 2100 (Kulp and Strauss, 2019; Kirezci et al., 2020; Rohmer et al., 2021). Above 3°C global warming levels (GWL) and with low adaptation, SLR may cause disruptions to ports and coastal infrastructure (Camus et al., 2019; Christodoulou et al., 2019; Verschuur et al., 2020; Yesudian and Dawson, 2021), which in turn may cascade and amplify across sectors and regions, generating impacts to financial systems (Chapters 11, 13; Mandel et al., 2021). Depending on the hydrogeological context, SLR causes salinisation of groundwater, estuaries, wetlands and soils, adding constraints to water management and livelihoods in agriculture sectors, for example, in deltas (Chapters 9, 15; Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Nicholls et al., 2020).Coastal ecosystems can migrate landward or grow vertically in response to SLR, but their resilience and capacity to keep up with SLR will be compromised by ocean warming and other drivers, depending on regions and species, for example, above 1.5°C for coral reefs (high confidence) (Chapters 3, 16; IPCC, 2018; Melbourne et al., 2018; Perry et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b; Cornwall et al., 2021). Sediments and space for landward retreat are crucial for mangroves, salt marshes and beach ecosystems (high confidence) (Chapter 3; Peteet et al., 2018; Schuerch et al., 2018; FitzGerald and Hughes, 2019; Friess et al., 2019; Leo et al., 2019; Schuerch et al., 2019). Loss of habitat is  accompanied  by  loss  of  associated  ecosystem  services,  including  wave-energy  attenuation,  habitat  provision  for  biodiversity,  food production and carbon storage (Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2).477Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesCross-Chapter Box SLR (continued)Under a high-emissions, low-likelihood/high-impact scenario, where low confidence ice-sheet mass loss occurs, global mean SLR could exceed the likely range by more than one additional metre in 2100 (Figure BoxSLR1b; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17; WGI AR6 Technical Summary and Chapter 9; Arias et al., 2021; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). This is a reason for concern given that rapid SLR after the last glacial–interglacial transition caused a drowning of coral reefs (high confidence) (Camoin and Webster, 2015; Sanborn et al., 2017; Webster  et  al.,  2018),  extensive  loss  of  coastal  land  and  islands,  habitats  and  associated  biodiversity  (high  confidence)  (AR6 WGI Chapter 9; Fruergaard et al., 2015; Fernández-Palacios et al., 2016; Hamilton et al., 2019; Helfensdorfer et al., 2019; Kane and Fletcher, 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), and triggered Neolithic migrations in Europe and Australia (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1; Turney and Brown, 2007; Brisset et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2018).At centennial time scales, projected SLR represents an existential threat for island nations, low-lying coastal zones and the communities, infrastructure,  and  cultural  heritage  therein  (Chapters  9–15;  Cross-Chapter  Paper  4).  Even  if  climate  warming  is  stabilised  at  2°C  to 2.5°C GWL, coastlines will continue to reshape over millennia, affecting at least 25 megacities and drowning low-lying areas where 0.6–1.3 billion people lived in 2010 (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Clark et al., 2016; Kulp and Strauss, 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Strauss et al., 2021).Solutions, opportunities and limits to adaptationThe ability to adapt to current coastal impacts, to cope with future coastal risks and to prevent further acceleration of SLR beyond 2050 depends on immediate mitigation and adaptation actions (very high confidence). The most urgent adaptation challenge is chronic flooding at  high  tide  (Chapters  10,  11,  13–15).  Reducing  the  acceleration  of  SLR  beyond  2050  will  only  be  achieved  with  fast  and  profound mitigation of climate change (Nicholls et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Until 2050, adaptation planning and implementation needs are projected to increase significantly in most inhabited coastal regions (see Figure BoxSLR1; WGI AR6 Chapter 9; IPCC, 2019b; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). For SSP1-2.6 and more strongly forced scenarios, SLR rates continue to increase (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), and so do the scale and frequency of adaptation interventions needed in coastal zones (Figure BoxSLR1; Haasnoot et al., 2020).3Risks  can  be  anticipated,  planned  and  decided  upon,  and  adaptation  interventions  can  be  implemented  over  the  coming  decades considering  their  often  long  lead-  and  lifetimes,  irrespective  of  the  large  uncertainty  about  SLR  beyond  2050  (high  confidence) (Figure  BoxSLR1;  Cross-Chapter  Box  DEEP  in  Chapter  17;  Cross-Chapter  Paper  2;  Chapters  11,  13;  Haasnoot  et  al.,  2018;  Stephens et al., 2018; Stammer et al., 2019). Adaptation capacity and governance to manage risks from projected SLR typically require decades to implement and institutionalise (high confidence) (Chapters 11, 13; Haasnoot et al., 2021). Without considering both short- and long-term adaptation needs, including beyond 2100, communities are increasingly confronted with a shrinking solution space, and adverse consequences are disproportionately borne by exposed and socially vulnerable people (Chapters 1, 8). Sea level rise is likely to compound social conflict in some settings (high confidence) (Oppenheimer et al., 2019).Coastal impacts of SLR can be avoided by preventing new development in exposed coastal locations (Chapters 3, 9–15; Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Doberstein et al., 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). For existing developments, a range of near-term adaptation options exists, including: (a) engineered, sediment- or ecosystem-based protection; (b) accommodation and land-use planning, to reduce the vulnerability of people and infrastructure; (c) advance through, for example, land reclamation; and (d) retreat through planned relocation or displacements and migrations due to SLR (Chapters 9–15; Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Only avoidance and relocation can remove coastal risks for the coming decades, while other measures only delay impacts for a time, have increasing residual risk or perpetuate risk and create ongoing legacy effects and virtually certain property and ecosystem losses (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Siders et al., 2019). Large-scale relocation has immense cultural, political, social and economic costs, and equity implications, which can be reduced by fast implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation policies (Chapter 8; Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Gibbs, 2015; Haasnoot et al., 2021). While relocation may currently appear socially unacceptable, economically inefficient or technically infeasible today (Lincke and Hinkel, 2021), it becomes the only feasible option as protection costs become unaffordable and the limits to accommodation become obvious (Chapters 11, 13, 15; Hino et al., 2017; Siders et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2021). Effective responses to rising sea level involve locally applicable combinations of decision analysis, land-use planning, public participation and conflict resolution approaches; together these can anticipate change and help to chart adaptation pathways, over time addressing the governance challenges due to rising sea level (high confidence) (Oppenheimer et al., 2019).Ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce impacts on human settlements and bring substantial co-benefits, such as ecosystem services restoration and carbon storage, but they require space for sediment and ecosystems and have site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5°C GWL (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Chapters 3, 9, 11, 15; Herbert et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2019; Van Coppenolle and Temmerman, 2019; Watanabe et al., 2019; Neijnens et al., 2021). For example, planting and conserving vegetation helps 478Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Cross-Chapter Box SLR (continued)sediment accumulation by dissipating wave energy and reducing impacts of storms, at least at present-day sea levels (high confidence) (Temmerman et al., 2013; Narayan et al., 2016; Romañach et al., 2018; Laengner et al., 2019; Leo et al., 2019). Coastal wetlands and ecosystems can be preserved by landward migration (Schuerch et al., 2018; Schuerch et al., 2019) or sediment supply (VanZomeren et al., 2018), but they can be seriously damaged by coastal defences designed to protect infrastructure (Chapters 3, 13; Cooper et al., 2020b). Sediment nourishment can prevent erosion, but it can also negatively impact beach amenities and ecosystems through ongoing dredging, pumping and deposition of sand and silts (VanZomeren et al., 2018; de Schipper et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021).Sea level rise challenges the timing of coastal adaptation planning and implementation(a) Typical timescales of coastal risk managementIndicative time for planning and implementationTypical intended lifetime of measures*Measures with long-living societal legacy*Planned relocation*Protect barriers*Protect leveesElevating housesSediment-based protectionEcosystem-based adaptation2020205021002150≈100 years≈100 years≈50 years≈30 years≈15 years≈15 years3(b) Sea-level rise projectionsmeters of globalsea level rise2.52.01.51.00.50SSP1-2.6SSP2-4.5SSP3-7.0SSP5-8.595th percentile and83rd percentile (low confidence processes)202020502100(c) Projected sea level rise demands earlier or larger adaptation actions and reduces the lifetimes of measuresIllustrative example with measures for 0.5m of additional sea level rise:SSP1-2.6 (p50)Lifetime ≈90 years≈120SSP2-4.5 (p50)Lifetime ≈75 years≈70SSP5-8.5 (p50)Lifetime ≈60 years≈4017th–83rd / 5th–95thpercentilemedium and lowconfidenceranges in 21502150SSP5-8.5 (p95)(low confidence process)Lifetime ≈30 years≈20≈20≈15≈10≈10≈10not assessed beyond 3m2020205021002150Figure Cross-Chapter BoxSLR.1 |  The challenge of coastal adaptation in the era of sea level rise (SLR): (a) typical time scales for the planning, implementation (grey triangles) and operational lifetime of current coastal risk-management measures (blue bars); (b) global sea level projections, which are representative of relative SLR projected for 60–70% of global shorelines, within ±20% errors (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021); (c) frequency of illustrative adaptation decisions to +0.5 m of SLR under different SSP-RCP scenarios. In response to accelerated SLR, adaptation either occurs earlier and faster, or accounts for higher amounts of SLR (e.g., to +1 m instead of to +0.5 m). Adaptation to +0.5 m from today’s sea levels have a lifetime of 90 years for SSP1-2.6, but lifetime is reduced to 60 years for SSP5-8.5 and 30 years for a high-end scenario involving low confidence processes. Adaptations to +0.5 m are comparable to, for example, the Thames Barrier in the United Kingdom or the Delta Works in the Netherlands, which primarily had an intended lifetime of 100–200 years. Adaptation measures to +0.2 m may include nourishment or wetland or setback zones.479Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesCross-Chapter Box SLR (continued)There is increasing evidence that current governance and institutional arrangements are unable to address the escalating risks in low-lying coastal areas worldwide (high confidence). Barriers to adaptation, such as decision making driven by short-term thinking or vested interests,  funding  limitations  and  inadequate  financial  policies  and  insurance,  can  be  addressed  equitably  and  sustainably  through implementation  of  suites  of  adaptation  options  and  pathways  (Chapters  11,  13,  17–18;  Cross-Chapter  Paper  2).  Improved  coastal adaptation governance can be supported by approaches that consider changing risks over time, such as ‘dynamic adaptation pathways’ planning  (Chapters  11,  13,  18;  Cross-Chapter  Box  DEEP  in  Chapter  17).  Integrated  coastal  zone  management  and  land-use  and infrastructure planning are starting to consider SLR by, for example, monitoring early signals (Haasnoot et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2020), updating sea level projections (Stephens et al., 2017; Hinkel et al., 2019; Kopp et al., 2019; Stammer et al., 2019), considering uncertainties of sea level projections and coastal impacts (e.g., Stephens et al., 2017; Jevrejeva et al., 2019; Rohmer et al., 2019), as well as engaging with communities, practitioners and scientists, recognising the values of current and future generations (e.g., Nicholls et al., 2014; Buchanan et al., 2016b). While there is high agreement that the majority of adaptation needs are not met yet, there is robust evidence of SLR increasingly being considered in coastal adaptation decision making and being embedded in national and local guidance and regulations (Nicholls et al., 2014; Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2018; Kopp et al., 2019; McEvoy et al., 2021).3and Tai, 2020). Conventional tools include catch and size limits, spatial management  and  adaptive  management.  Ecosystem-based  fisheries management outperforms single-species management (Fulton et al., 2019),  is  widely  legislated  (Bryndum-Buchholz  et  al.,  2021)  and can  reduce  climate  impacts  in  fisheries  in  the  near-term,  especially under  low-emission  scenarios  (Karp  et  al.,  2019;  Holsman  et  al., 2020).  Transboundary  agreements  on  shifting  fisheries  will  reduce the risk of overharvesting (medium confidence) (Gaines et al., 2018). Permits  tradable  across  political  boundaries  could  also  address  this challenge,  but  limited  evidence  is  available  regarding  their  efficacy (Cross-Chapter  Box  MOVING  SPECIES  in  Chapter  5;  Pinsky  et  al., 2018).  Climate-smart  conservation  (Section  3.6.32.1)  under  the negotiations  on  areas  beyond  national  jurisdiction  (ABNJ)  (Pinsky et al., 2018; Tittensor et al., 2019; Frazão Santos et al., 2020), and in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) areas designed as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) (Tittensor et al., 2019),  provide  further  benefits.  Despite  the  potential  for  adaptive management  to  achieve  sustainable  fisheries,  outcomes  will  very likely be inequitable (Gaines et al., 2018; Lam et al., 2020), with lower-income countries suffering the greater biomass and economic losses, increasing  inequalities,  especially  under  higher-emission  scenarios (high  confidence)  (Boyce  et  al.,  2020).  Flexible  and  polycentric governance approaches have facilitated some short-term successes in achieving equitable, sustainable fisheries practices, but these may be challenging to implement where other governance systems, especially hierarchical systems, are well established (Cvitanovic et al., 2018; Bell et al., 2020).3.6.3.1.3  Tourismbreakwaters and groins, and NbS (Section 3.6.2.1), are becoming more common,  partly  due  to  demand  from  the  tourism  industry  (medium confidence) (Pranzini, 2018; Pranzini et al., 2018).Elsewhere, interactions between tourism and climate impacts worsen outcomes  for  coastal  and  ocean  environments  (Section  3.6.3.1.4). Climate  change  is  opening  up  new  cruise-ship  routes  in  the  Arctic (Sun  et  al.,  2018),  increasing  the  number  of  visitors  and  associated stressors, such as litter, to previously undisturbed areas (Anfuso et al., 2020;  Hovelsrud  et  al.,  2020;  Suaria  et  al.,  2020).  Risk  reduction  for cruise-ship tourism includes disaster response management, improved mapping and passenger codes of conduct ensuring social, cultural and ecological sustainability (Stewart et al., 2015; Dawson et al., 2016).Marine ecotourism, integrating conservation, education and provision of benefits to local communities (Donohoe and Needham, 2006) can provide significant economic benefits (Wabnitz, 2019) and is among the  most  common  livelihood  alternatives  to  support  both  marine conservation  and  climate-change  adaptation  (Kutzner,  2019;  Pham, 2020; Prasetyo et al., 2020). Ecotourism can enhance social and political will  for  marine  conservation  (Cisneros-Montemayor  and  Sumaila, 2014)  and  facilitates  integration  of  local  and  Indigenous  Peoples  in employment,  ownership  and  industry  governance.  The  community of  Cabo  Pulmo,  Mexico,  self-imposed  an  MPA  and  replaced  fishing with ecotourism, which now generates millions of USD yr–1, sustains locally owned and operated tour companies and has increased some fish populations tenfold (Knowlton, 2020). In Misool, Indonesia, local ecotourism incorporates IK by including local communities’ preferences and sustainable resource use (Prasetyo et al., 2020).Coastal  areas,  coastal  infrastructure  and  beaches,  sustaining  tourism that  contributes  significantly  to  local  economies  (James  et  al.,  2019; Ruiz-Ramírez et al., 2019), are under threat from development, SLR and increased wave energy during storms (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.2.4–3.4.2.6, 3.5.6, SM3.3.1; Lithgow et al., 2019; Ruiz-Ramírez et al., 2019). Engineered solutions, such as seawalls and revetments, have traditionally been  used  to  address  coastal  erosion  (Section  3.6.3.1.1),  but  soft infrastructure  approaches,  including  beach  nourishment,  submerged Unintended consequences of ecotourism, such as detrimental ecological impacts on reefs (Giglio et al., 2020), sharks, marine birds (Monti et al., 2018) and whales (Higham et al., 2016; Barra et al., 2020; Hoarau et al., 2020),  can  be  minimised  by  relying  on  evidence-based  management of  associated  activities  (Blumstein  et  al.,  2017).  Public  perception  of climate-change connections to tourism can create obstacles (Meynecke et al., 2017; Atzori et al., 2018) such as deterring long-term investment in  SIDS  tourism  initiatives  (Santos-Lacueva  et  al.,  2017),  or  benefits 480Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3like inclining tourists to participate in conservation projects (Curnock et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020b; Ziegler et al., 2021). Social and cultural networks  may  decrease  climate  vulnerability,  as  with  Indigenous tourism  operators  in  SIDS  (Parsons  et  al.,  2018).  Tourism-based adaptation  can  also  be  improved  by  equitable  access  to  resources as well as recognition and inclusion of all stakeholders during policy planning and implementation. The principles of marine spatial planning (Papageorgiou, 2016) provide for effectively incorporating stakeholders and could inform development of activities to assess climate-associated risks  (e.g., Tzoraki  et  al.,  2018;  Loehr,  2020). The  recent  decrease  in global tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic may offer opportunities to transform existing practices to more sustainable approaches (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7; Gössling et al., 2021).3.6.3.1.4  Maritime transportIncreased maritime transport and cruise-ship tourism in the Arctic are already  impacting  local  and  Indigenous  Peoples,  revealing  conflicts over the uses of the ocean and the governance needed to support local people and a sustainable blue economy (high confidence) (Debortoli et al., 2019; Palma et al., 2019; Berman et al., 2020; Dundas et al., 2020). While shipping and its associated environmental impacts are projected to grow (Palma et al., 2019; Dawson et al., 2020), adaptation efforts are only at the planning stage (Debortoli et al., 2019). Increased Arctic traffic  due  to  ice  loss  can  benefit  trade,  transportation  and  tourism (medium  confidence),  but  will  also  affect  Arctic  marine  ecosystems and livelihoods (high confidence) (Palma et al., 2019; Dawson et al., 2020). Increasing search-and-rescue activities (Ford and Clark, 2019) reveal capacity gaps to support future demands (Ford and Clark, 2019; Palma et al., 2019). The Low-Impact Shipping Corridors initiative has been developed as an adaptation strategy in the Arctic, although with limited inclusion of IKLK (Dawson et al., 2020).Relative  SLR  and  the  increased  frequency  and  severity  of  storms are  already  affecting  port  activity,  infrastructure  and  supply  chains, sometimes  disrupting  trade  and  transport  (Monios  and Wilmsmeier, 2020),  but  these  hazards  are  not  systematically  incorporated  into adaptation  planning  (medium  evidence)  (Monios  and  Wilmsmeier, 2020;  O’Keeffe  et  al.,  2020).  Climate-change  impacts  that  increase food  insecurity,  income  loss  and  poverty  can  exacerbate  maritime criminal  activity,  including  illegal  fishing,  drug  trafficking  or  piracy (medium evidence) (Germond and Mazaris, 2019). A transformational adaptation approach to address climate impacts on maritime activities and  increase  security  (Germond  and  Mazaris,  2019)  would  relocate ports, change centres of demand, reduce shipping distances or shorten supply  chains  (medium  agreement)  (Walsh  et  al.,  2019;  Monios  and Wilmsmeier, 2020) as well as decrease marginalisation of vulnerable groups,  develop  polycentric  governance  systems  and  eliminate maladaptive environmental policies and resource loss (Belhabib et al., 2020; O’Keeffe et al., 2020).3.6.3.1.5  Human healthHealth-focused  adaptations  to  climate-driven  changes  in  ocean  and coastal water quality (Section 3.5.5.3) leverage mainly technology and infrastructure (Section 3.6.2.2) to improve water-quality monitoring and forecasting  to  inform  socio-institutional  adaptation  (Section  3.6.2.1) and NbS (Section 3.6.2.3). Seafood quality and safety are decreasing due  to  climate-driven  increases  in  marine-borne  diseases  (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2), toxic HABs or toxin bioaccumulation (high agreement) (Karagas et al., 2012; Krabbenhoft and Sunderland, 2013;  Rafaj  et  al.,  2013;  Curtis  et  al.,  2019;  Schartup  et  al.,  2019; Thackray  and  Sunderland,  2019).  Future  exposure  to  seafood-borne contaminants also depends partly on consumers’ seafood preferences (Elsayed  et  al.,  2020)  and  seafood  supply  (Sunderland  et  al.,  2018). Reducing this risk by decreasing seafood consumption increases the risk of eating less nutritious foods, and loss of cultural practices (Chapter 5; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5; Donatuto et al., 2011; Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a).  Models  incorporating  high-resolution  satellite images,  field  survey  data,  meteorological  observations  and  historical records can provide early-warning forecasts of HABs or conditions that favour  microbial  pathogen  outbreaks  (Cross-Chapter  Box  ILLNESS  in Chapter  2;  Semenza  et  al.,  2017;  Franks,  2018;  Hattenrath-Lehmann et al., 2018; Borbor-Cordova et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019; Campbell et  al.,  2020a;  Davidson  et  al.,  2021).  Forecasts  facilitate  preventive public health measures (World Health Organisation and United Nations Children’s  Fund,  2017),  or  seafood  harvest  guidance  (Maguire  et  al., 2016; Leadbetter et al., 2018; Anderson et al., 2019; Bolin et al., 2021), reducing risks of disease outbreaks, waste and contaminated seafood entering the market (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in  Chapter  2;  Nichols  et  al.,  2018).  Monitoring  of  water  quality  and seafood safety (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2), paired with effective public communication and education (Ekstrom et al., 2020), inform individual and local adaptations, including use of (a) personal protective equipment, (b) seafood selection and preparation (Elsayed et al., 2020; Froelich and Daines, 2020; Fielding et al., 2021), (c) income diversification  (Section  3.6.2.1;  Moore  et  al.,  2020b),  (d)  public education (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2019) or (e) community-level actions to decrease risk from coastal aquifer and soil salinisation (Slama et al., 2020; Mastrocicco and Colombani, 2021), HAB toxins (Ekstrom et al., 2020) and other contaminants (e.g., methylmercury, metals, persistent organic pollutants) in seafood (Chan et al., 2021). A full assessment of climate-change  impacts  on  human  health  is  found  in  Chapter  7  and Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2.3.6.3.2 Cross-Cutting Solutions for Coastal and Ocean EcosystemsSROCC concluded that protection, restoration and pollution reduction can support ocean and coastal ecosystems (high confidence), and that EbA lowers climate risks locally and provides multiple societal benefits (high confidence) (IPCC, 2019c). This section updates the assessment of the effectiveness of these strategies for addressing climate impacts.3.6.3.2.1   Area-based protection: MPAs for adapting to climate changeMarine protected areas are the most widely implemented area-based management  approach  (Section  3.6.2.3.2),  commonly intended to  conserve,  preserve  or  restore  biodiversity  and  habitats,  protect species or manage resources (especially fisheries) (National Research Council,  2001).  By August  2021,  7.74%  of  the  ocean  was  protected (in both MPAs and OECMs) (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2021), primarily within nations’ exclusive economic zones (EEZs).

However, in 2021 only 2.7% of the ocean  was  in  fully  or  highly  protected  MPAs  (Marine  Conservation Institute, 2021), the hard-to-achieve states that most effectively rebuild biomass  and  fish  community  structure  (Sala  and  Giakoumi,  2017; Bergseth, 2018; Zupan et al., 2018; Ohayon et al., 2021). Only 1.18% of ABNJ  is  protected  (UNEP-WCMC  and  IUCN,  2021),  mostly  due  to governance  limitations  (O’Leary  and  Roberts,  2017; Vijayaraghavan, 2021), but calls to protect more ABNJ emphasise the need to protect the habitats of long-range pelagic fish and marine mammals, maintain the ocean’s regulating functions and minimise impacts from uses such as maritime shipping or deep-sea mining (Table 3.30).Marine  protected  areas  are  theorised  to  facilitate  ecological  climate adaptation  and  contribute  to  SDG14  (Life  Below  Water)  (Table  3.30; 482   Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Figure  3.26;  Bates  et  al.,  2014;  Lubchenco  and  Grorud-Colvert,  2015; Gattuso  et  al.,  2018)  because  they  alleviate  non-climate  drivers  and promote  biodiversity  (i.e.,  ‘managed  resilience  hypothesis’)  (Bruno et  al.,  2019;  Maestro  et  al.,  2019;  Cinner  et  al.,  2020).  Current  MPAs offer conservation benefits such as increases in biomass and diversity of habitats, populations and communities (high confidence) (Pendleton et al., 2018; Bates et al., 2019; Stevenson et al., 2020; Lenihan et al., 2021; Ohayon et al., 2021), and these benefits may last after some (possibly climate-enhanced) disturbances (e.g., tropical cyclones) (McClure et al., 2020).  But  current  MPAs  do  not  provide  resilience  against  observed warming and heatwaves in tropical-to-temperate ecosystems (medium confidence) (Bates et al., 2019; Bruno et al., 2019; Freedman et al., 2020; Graham  et  al.,  2020;  Rilov  et  al.,  2020). There  is  robust  evidence  that processes  around  MPA  design  and  implementation  strongly  influence whether  outcomes  are  beneficial  or  harmful  for  adjacent  human communities (McNeill et al., 2018; Zupan et al., 2018; Ban et al., 2019).Current  placement  and  extent  of  MPAs  will  not  provide  substantial protections  against  projected  climate  change  past  2050  (high confidence),  as  the  placement  of  MPAs  has  been  driven  more  often by political expediency (e.g., Leenhardt et al., 2013) than by managing key drivers of biodiversity loss (Cockerell et al., 2020; Stevenson et al., 2020)  or  climate-induced  drivers  (Bruno  et  al.,  2018).  Only  3.5%  of the  area  currently  protected  will  provide  refuges  from  both  SST and  deoxygenation  by  2050  under  both  RCP4.5  and  RCP8.5  (Bruno et  al.,  2018),  and  MPAs  are  more  exposed  to  climate  change  under RCP8.5 than non-MPAs (Section 3.4.3.3.4; Figure 3.20d). Community thermal  tolerances  will  be  exceeded  by  2050  in  the  tropics  and  by 2150 for many higher-latitude MPAs (Bruno et al., 2018). Most MPA design has focused on the surface ocean, but MPAs are assumed to protect the entire water column and benthos. Climate-induced drivers (Section  3.2)  throughout  the  water  column  and  rapidly  accelerating climate velocities at depths below 200 m (Johnson et al., 2018; Brito-Morales et al., 2020) are projected to affect virtually all North Atlantic deep-water  and  open-ocean  area-based  management  zones  in  the next 20–50 years (Johnson et al., 2018), and the conservation goals of benthic MPAs in the North Sea are not expected to be fulfilled (Weinert et al., 2021). Heightened risk of non-indigenous species immigration from vessel traffic plus climate change further endangers MPA success (Iacarella  et  al.,  2020),  a  particular  concern  in  the  Mediterranean (D’Amen  and  Azzurro,  2020;  Mannino  and  Balistreri,  2021),  where the  current  MPA  network  is  already  highly  vulnerable  to  climate change  (Kyprioti  et  al.,  2021). This  new  evidence  supports  SROCC’s high  confidence  assessment  that  present  governance  arrangements, including MPAs, are too fragmented to provide integrated responses to the increasing and cascading risks from climate change in the ocean (SROCC SPMC1.2; IPCC, 2019c).Strategic  conservation  planning  can  yield  future  MPA  networks substantially  more  ready  for  climate  change  (e.g.,  Section  3.6.3.1.5; SROCC SPM C2.1; IPCC, 2019c; Frazão Santos et al., 2020; Rassweiler et  al.,  2020).  Global  protection  is  increasing  (Worm,  2017;  Claudet et  al.,  2020b)  as  nations  pursue  international  targets  (e.g.,  SDG14, Life  Below  Water  aimed  to  conserve  10%  of  the  ocean  by  2020), and  the  UN  CBD  proposes  to  protect  30%  by  2030  (Section  3.6.4; SM3.5.3;  CBD,  2020).  A  growing  body  of  evidence  (Tittensor  et  al., 2019;  Zhao  et  al.,  2020a;  Pörtner  et  al.,  2021b;  Sala  et  al.,  2021) underscores  the  urgent  need  to  pursue  biodiversity,  ecosystem-service provision and climate-adaptation goals simultaneously, while acknowledging inherent trade-offs (Claudet et al., 2020a; Sala et al., 2021).  Frameworks  to  create  ‘climate-smart’  MPAs  (Tittensor  et  al., 2019) generally include: (a) defining conservation goals that embrace resource  vulnerabilities  and  co-occurring  hazards;  (b)  carefully selecting  adaptation  strategies  that  include  IKLK  while  respecting Indigenous rights and accommodating human behaviour (Kikiloi et al., 2017;  Thomas,  2018;  Yates  et  al.,  2019;  Failler  et  al.,  2020;  Wilson et al., 2020a; Croke, 2021; Reimer et al., 2021; Vijayaraghavan, 2021); (c)  developing  protection  that  is  appropriate  for  all  ocean  depths (Brito-Morales  et  al.,  2018;  Frazão  Santos  et  al.,  2020; Wilson  et  al., 2020a), especially considering climate velocity (Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2021); (d) using dynamic national and international management tools to accommodate extreme events or species distribution shifts (Gaines et  al.,  2018;  Pinsky  et  al.,  2018;  Bindoff  et  al.,  2019a;  Scheffers  and Pecl,  2019; Tittensor  et  al.,  2019;  Cashion  et  al.,  2020;  Crespo  et  al., 2020; Frazão Santos et al., 2020; Maxwell et al., 2020b), which could build on dynamic regulations already in place for fishing or ship strikes (Maxwell  et  al.,  2020b);  and  (e)  seeking  to  increase  connectivity (Wilson et al., 2020a), using genomic or multi-species model insights (Xuereb et al., 2020; Friesen et al., 2021; Lima et al., 2021).There is growing international support for a 30% conservation target for 2030 (Gurney et al., 2021), which will need efforts beyond protected areas. For example, OECMs recognise management interventions that sustain biodiversity, irrespective of their main objective (Maxwell et al., 2020b; Gurney et al., 2021). There is high agreement on the potential of  OECMs  to  contribute  to  conservation  and  equity,  for  example,  by recognising  Indigenous  territories  as  OECMs  (Maxwell  et  al.,  2020b; Gurney et al., 2021); however, the capacity of these conservation tools to provide adaptation outcomes remains unexplored.In summary, MPAs and other marine spatial-planning tools have great potential  to  address  climate-change  mitigation  and  adaptation  in ocean and coastal ecosystems, if they are designed and implemented in a coordinated way that takes into account ecosystem vulnerability and responses to projected climate conditions, considers existing and future ecosystem uses and non-climate drivers, and supports effective governance (high confidence).3.6.3.2.2  Ecological restoration, interventions and their limitationsRestoration  of  degraded  ecosystems  is  a  common  NbS  increasingly deployed  at  local  scales  in  response  to  climate  change  (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Duarte et al., 2020; Bertolini and da Mosto, 2021; Braun de Torrez et al., 2021). Despite covering limited areas  and  having  uncertain  efficacy  under  future  climate  change (Gordon et al., 2020), these actions have successfully restored marine populations and ecosystems at regional to global scales (Duarte et al., 2020), and enhanced livelihoods and the well-being of coastal peoples as  well  as  the  biodiversity  and  resilience  of  ecological  communities (Silver et al., 2019; Gordon et al., 2020; Braun de Torrez et al., 2021). Technology-based  approaches,  such  as  active  restoration,  assisted evolution  and  ecological  forecasting,  can  aid  in  moving  beyond restoring  ecosystems  (Section  3.6.2.3)  towards  enhancing  resilience, reviving  biodiversity  and  guarding  against  loss  of  foundational, 34833Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesornamental or iconic species (Bulleri et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019a; da Silva et al., 2019; National Academies of Sciences, 2019; Boström-Einarsson  et  al.,  2020;  Fredriksen  et  al.,  2020;  Morris  et  al.,  2020c; Kleypas et al., 2021).Local  restoration  projects  often  target  vegetated  ecosystems  like mangroves,  seagrasses  and  salt  marshes  that  are  valued  and  used by  coastal  communities  (Veettil  et  al.,  2019;  Duarte  et  al.,  2020; Wu et  al.,  2020a;  Bertolini  and  da  Mosto,  2021).  Detail  on  mangroves and corals as EbA and protection/restoration hotspots is provided in SM3.8.  Common  and  effective  actions  (Sasmito  et  al.,  2019;  Duarte et  al.,  2020;  Oreska  et  al.,  2020)  include  securing  accommodation space (Sections 3.4.2.4–3.4.2.5), restoring hydrological (Kroeger et al., 2017; Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020) and sediment dynamics; managing harvesting  (particularly  in  mangroves);  reducing  pollution  (especially in seagrasses) (de los Santos et al., 2019); and replanting appropriate species in suitable environmental settings (Wodehouse and Rayment, 2019; Friess et al., 2020a). Although efficacy is context dependent (Zeng et al., 2020; Krause-Jensen et al., 2021) and implementation is most often local (Alongi, 2018a), such projects facilitate tangible community engagement  in  climate  action.  Moreover,  because  these  ecosystems sequester disproportionate amounts of carbon (blue carbon) (Annex II: Glossary; see Box 3.4), restoration supports climate-change mitigation (Lovelock  and  Reef,  2020;  Gattuso  et  al.,  2021).  Yet,  constraints remain. For instance, Southeast Asia has 1.21 million km2 of terrestrial, freshwater and mangrove area biophysically suitable for reforestation, which could mitigate 3.43 ± 1.29 Pg CO2e yr−1 through 2030; however, reforestation is only feasible in a small fraction of this area (0.3–18%) given financial, land-use and operational constraints (Zeng et al., 2020). Nevertheless,  the  multiple  benefits  offered  by  ecosystem  restoration will likely outweigh competing costs and increase its relevance as part of  adaptation-strategy  portfolios  (Silver  et  al.,  2019; Wedding  et  al., 2021), national carbon-accounting systems and nationally determined contributions by parties to the Paris Agreement (Friess et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020a).2019;  Coleman  et  al.,  2020b;  Fredriksen  et  al.,  2020;  Wade  et  al., 2020). Managed breeding of corals has also had limited success in the laboratory and at small local scales (National Academies of Sciences, 2019). There is also limited evidence that physiological interventions, such  as  algal-symbiont  or  microbiome  manipulation,  could  increase coral thermal tolerance in the field (National Academies of Sciences, 2019).  Employing  the  natural  adaptive  capacity  of  species  or individuals  in  active  restoration  for  corals  and  kelps  with  current technology  involves  fewer  risks  than  assisted  evolution  or  long-distance  relocation  (high  confidence)  (Filbee-Dexter  and  Smajdor, 2019;  National  Academies  of  Sciences,  2019).  More  ambitious engineered  interventions  like  reef  shading  remain  theoretical  and not scalable to the reef level (Condie et al., 2021). Debate continues on how to apply planned adaptation in cost-effective ways that will accomplish the intended goals (National Academies of Sciences, 2019; Duarte et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021).Models show that a combination of available management approaches (restoration, reducing non-climate drivers) and speculative interventions (e.g., enhanced corals, reef shading) can contribute to sustaining some coral reefs beyond 1.5°C of global warming with declining effectiveness beyond  2°C  of  global  warming  (medium  confidence)  (Figure  3.25; WGII  Chapter  17).  These  proposed  interventions  are  also  currently theoretical and impractical over large scales; for example, engineered solutions like reef shading are untested and not scalable at the reef level (Condie  et  al., 2021). Existing  projects suggest  that restoration and ecological interventions to habitat-forming ecosystems have the additional  benefits  of  raising  local  awareness,  promoting  tourism, and creating jobs and economic benefits (Fadli et al., 2012; Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Hafezi et al., 2021), provided communities are involved  in  planning,  operation  and  monitoring  (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020).3.6.3.3 Enablers, Barriers and Limitations of Adaptation and MitigationRestoration  efficacy  of  coral  reefs,  kelp  forests  and  other  habitat-forming coastal ecosystems (Sections 3.4.2.2–3.4.2.6) are jeopardised by the near-term nature of climate-driven risks (McLeod et al., 2019; National  Academies  of  Sciences,  2019;  Coleman  et  al.,  2020b). Modelling  studies  indicate  that  available  practices  will  not  prevent degradation  of  coral  reefs  from  &gt;1.5°C  of  global  average  surface warming  (Figure  3.25;  National  Academies  of  Sciences  Engineering and Medicine, 2019; Condie et al., 2021; Hafezi et al., 2021). Proposed interventions  include  assisted  migration  (Boström-Einarsson  et  al., 2020; Fredriksen et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020c), assisted evolution (Bay  et  al.,  2019;  National Academies  of  Sciences,  2019)  and  other engineering  solutions  like  artificial  shading  and  enhanced  upwelling (Condie et al., 2021; Kleypas et al., 2021).Not  only  is  mitigation  necessary  to  support  ocean  and  coastal adaptation  (Pörtner  et  al.,  2014;  Oppenheimer  et  al.,  2019),  but  the global  emission  pathways  also  impose  limits  to  ocean  and  coastal adaptation, with lower warming levels enabling greater effectiveness of  adaptations  (high  confidence)  (Figure  3.25).  Chapter  17  broadly assesses the limits to adaptation, while this section focuses on barriers and  limits  to  adaptation  imposed  by  cultural  (Section  3.6.3.3.1), economic  (Section  3.6.3.3.2)  and  governance  (Section  3.6.3.3.3) dimensions (Hinkel et al., 2018). Globally, these factors more strongly influence  ocean  development  than  does  local  natural  resource availability  (Cisneros-Montemayor  et  al.,  2021),  and  are  key  to avoiding maladaptation. This section also assesses enablers and limits to mitigation (Section 3.6.3.3.4).Transplanting heat-tolerant coral colonies can increase reef resistance to  bleaching  (Morikawa  and  Palumbi,  2019;  Howells  et  al.,  2021) but  potentially  lower  species  diversity  and  alter  ecosystem  function (Section  3.4.2.1).  Genetic  manipulation  or  assisted  evolution  that propagates  genes  from  heat-tolerant  populations  could  enhance restoration of corals (Anthony et al., 2017; Epstein et al., 2019) and kelp  (medium  agreement,  limited  evidence)  (Coleman  and  Goold, 3.6.3.3.1  Sociocultural dimensions (culture, ethics, identity, behaviour)Every  coastal  community  values  marine  ecosystems  for  more  than the  material  and  intangible  resources  they  deliver,  or  the  physical protection they offer (Díaz et al., 2018).

Furthermore,  interactions  between  climate impacts  and  existing  inequalities  can  threaten  the  human  rights  of already-marginalised  peoples  by  disrupting  livelihoods  and  food security, which further  erodes  people’s  social,  economic  and cultural rights  (Finkbeiner  et  al.,  2018).  For  instance,  European  colonisation and  ongoing  development  blocked  the  Cucapá  Indigenous  People’s access and rights to resources in the Colorado River Delta, USA, over the 20th century. Recent reallocation of water rights and fishing access is  allowing  the  Cucapá  people  to  reconstruct  their  cultural  identity (Sangha et al., 2019), but future climate-change impacts could reverse the community’s recovery of their cultural heritage. Adaptations that consider local needs may help sustain cultural services (Ortíz Liñán and Vázquez Solís, 2021).Interactions with oceans are fundamental to the identities of many coastal Indigenous  Peoples  (Norman,  2017),  and  this  influences  Indigenous responses  to  climate  hazards  and  adaptation.  Around  30  million Indigenous  Peoples  live  along  coasts  (Cisneros-Montemayor  et  al., 2016). Seafood consumption among Indigenous Peoples is much higher than for non-Indigenous populations, and marine species support many cultural, medicinal and traditional activities contributing to public health (Section 3.5.3.1; Kenny et al., 2018). Perpetuation of Indigenous cultures depends on protecting marine ecosystems and on adapting to changes in  self-led  ways  (Section  3.5.6;  Sangha  et  al.,  2019)  that  promote  self-determination  (von  der  Porten  et  al.,  2019).  Indigenous  resurgence,  or reinvigorating Indigenous ways of life and traditional management, can include marine resource protection and ocean-sector development founded on culturally appropriate strategies and partnerships that are consistent 485       Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Serviceswith  traditional  norms  and  beneficial  to  local  communities  (von  der Porten et al., 2019). Successful adaptation would simultaneously improve ecosystem health and address current and historical inequities (Bennett, 2018).  Examples  include  practicing  traditional  resource  management, protecting traditional territories, engaging with monitoring, collaborations with  non-Indigenous  partners  and  reinvesting  benefits  into  capacity-building within communities (von der Porten et al., 2019; Equator Initiative, 2020). The legitimacy of different adaptation strategies depends on local and  Indigenous  Peoples’  acceptance,  which  is  based  on  cultural  values (Adger et al., 2017); financial gain cannot compensate for loss of IK or LK (Wilson et al., 2020b). Palau’s recent goal of shifting seafood consumption away  from  reef  fishes  (Remengesau  Jr.,  2019)  as  well  as  limiting  and closely  monitoring  the  expansion  of  ecotourism  was  prompted  by  the cultural  importance  of  protecting  these  reefs  and  associated  traditional fisheries for local consumption, a recognition of the importance of tourism and the hazard of climate change (Wabnitz et al., 2018a).Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 3.5 | How can nature-based solutions, including marine protected areas, help us to adapt to climate-driven changes in the oceans?Coastal habitats, such as mangroves or vegetated dunes, protect coastal communities from sea level rise and storm surges while supporting fisheries, sequestering carbon and providing other ecosystem services as well. Efforts to restore, conserve and/or recover these natural habitats help people confront the impacts of climate change. These marine nature-based solutions (NbS), such as Marine protected areas (MPAs), habitat restoration and sustainable fisheries, are cost-effective and provide myriad benefits to society.3In  the  oceans,  NbS  comprise  attempts  to  recover,  restore  or  conserve  coastal  and  marine  habitats  to  reduce  the impacts  of  climate  change  on  nature  and  society.  Marine  habitats,  such  as  seagrasses  and  coral  reefs,  provide services like food and flood regulation in the same way as forests do on land. Coastal habitats, such as mangroves or vegetated dunes, protect coastal communities from sea level rise and storm surges while supporting fisheries as well as recreational and aesthetic services. Seagrasses, coral reefs and kelp forests also provide important benefits that help humans adapt to climate change, including sustainable fishing, recreation and shoreline protection services. By recognising these services and benefits of the ocean, NbS can improve the quality and integrity of the marine ecosystems.Nature-based solutions offer a wide range of potential benefits, including protecting ecosystem services, supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Coastal and marine examples include MPAs, habitat restoration, habitat development  and  maintaining  sustainable  fisheries.  While  local  communities  with  limited  resources  might  find NbS challenging to implement, they are generally ‘no-regret’ options, which bring societal and ecological benefits regardless of the level of climate change.Carefully designed and placed MPAs, especially when they exclude fishing, can increase resilience to climate change by removing additional stressors on ecosystems. While MPAs do not prevent extreme events, such as marine heatwaves (FAQ3.2), they can provide marine plants and animals with a better chance to adapt to a changing climate. Current MPAs, however, are often too small, too poorly connected and too static to account for climate-induced shifts in the range of marine species. MPA networks that are large, connected, have adaptable boundaries and are designed following systematic analysis of future climate projections can better support climate resilience.Habitat  restoration  and  development  in  coastal  systems  can  support  biodiversity,  protect  communities  from flooding and erosion, support the local economy and enhance the livelihoods and well-being of coastal peoples. Restoration of mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows provide effective ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and at the same time protect coasts from the impacts of storms and SLR. Active restoration techniques that target heat-resistant individuals or species are increasingly recommended for coral reefs and kelp forests, which are highly vulnerable to marine heatwaves and climate change.Sustainable fishing is also seen as an NbS because managing marine commercial species within sustainable limits maximises  the  catch  and  food  production,  thus  contributing  to  the  UN’s  Sustainable  Development  Goal  2  (Zero Hunger).  Currently,  the  oceans  provide  17%  of  the  animal  protein  eaten  by  the  global  population,  but  the contribution could be larger if fisheries were managed sustainably. Aquaculture, such as oyster farming, can be an efficient and sustainable means of food production and also provide additional benefits like shoreline protection. Through NbS that conserve and restore marine habitats and species, we can sustain marine biodiversity, respond to climate change and provide benefits to society.486Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Box FAQ 3.5 (continued)Contributions of nature-based solutions in the oceans to the Sustainable Development GoalsContributions to Sustainable Development GoalsN a t u r e Based SolutionsC onservationMarine protected areas(MPA)nRestora ti oCoral reefsSustainablefisheriesMarine habitatsBlue carbon ecosystemsConservationNatureBasedSolutions3Figure FAQ3.5.1 |  Contributions of nature-based solutions (NbS) in the oceans to the Sustainable Development Goals.

Studies in SIDS and the Arctic have shown how IKLK facilitate the  success  of  EbA  (Nalau  et  al.,  2018;  Peñaherrera-Palma  et  al., 2018;  Raymond-Yakoubian  and  Daniel,  2018),  reinforce  and  improve institutional  approaches  and  enhance  the  provision  of  ecosystem services  (Ross  et  al.,  2019;  Terra  Stori  et  al.,  2019).  Perspectives  on adaptation also vary among groups of age, race, (dis)ability, class, caste and gender (Wilson et al., 2020b), so engaging different groups results in  more  robust  and  equitable  adaptation  to  climate  change  (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18; McLeod et al., 2018). Some coastal communities have developed substantial social capital and dense local networks  based  on  trust  and  reciprocity  (Petzold  and  Ratter,  2015), with individual and community flexibility to learn, adapt and organise 4873Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesthemselves  to  help  local  adaptation  governance  (Silva  et  al.,  2020). Recent  evidence  suggests  that  policies  supporting  local  institutions can improve adaptation outcomes (medium confidence) (Berman et al., 2020). Coastal communities can be engaged using novel approaches to co-generate adaptation solutions (van der Voorn et al., 2017; Flood et  al.,  2018)  that  benefit  education  (Koenigstein  et  al.,  2020)  and engagement in adaptation processes (Rumore et al., 2016). Successful adaptation implementation in line with climate resilient development pathways (WGII Chapter 18) depends on bottom-up, participatory and inclusive processes (Section 3.6.1.2.1) that engage diverse stakeholders (Basel et al., 2020; McNamara et al., 2020; Ogier et al., 2020; Williams et  al.,  2020)  and  protect  Indigenous  customary  rights  (Farbotko  and McMichael, 2019; Ford et al., 2020), empower women and give rights to climate refugees (McLeod et al., 2018).3.6.3.3.2  Economic dimensions (planning, finance, costs)Finance  is  a  key  barrier  globally  for  ocean  health,  governance  and adaptation  to  climate  change  (high  agreement)  (Annex  II:  Glossary; Cross-Chapter  Box  FINANCE  in  Chapter  17;  Hinkel  et  al.,  2018; Miller et al., 2018; Wabnitz and Blasiak, 2019; Woodruff et al., 2020; Sumaila et al., 2021). Global adaptation finance was estimated to total 30 billion USD yr–1 in 2017–2018, or 5% of all climate finance (CPI, 2019), with no tracking specifically for coastal or marine adaptation in low- to middle-income countries. Marine-focused adaptation finance is difficult to trace and label due to the cross-sectoral nature of many projects (Blasiak and Wabnitz, 2018) and the lack of clear definitions about what qualifies as adaptation or as new and additional finance (Donner  et  al.,  2016;  Weikmans  and  Roberts,  2019).  Finance  for marine conservation from Overseas Development Assistance doubled between 2003 and 2016, reaching 634 million USD in 2016, similar to the level provided by philanthropic foundations (Berger et al., 2019). Yet coastal adaptation to SLR alone is projected to cost hundreds of billions  of  USD  yr–1,  depending  on  the  model  and  emission  scenario (e.g., Wong et al., 2014; Nicholls et al., 2019). Economic and financing barriers  to  marine  adaptation  are  often  higher  in  low-  to  middle-income countries, where resources influence governance and constrain options  for  implementation  and  maintenance  (high  confidence) (Hinkel et al., 2018; Klöck and Nunn, 2019; Tompkins et al., 2020), and impacts  on  their  coastal  and  marine  ecosystems  could  total  several percentage points of their gross domestic product (Wong et al., 2014). Current financial flows are insufficient to meet the costs of coastal and marine impacts of climate change (very high confidence) and ocean-focused finance is unevenly distributed, with higher flows within, and to, developed countries (very high confidence).Development  assistance  can  help  resolve  resource  constraints, but  additional  governance  and  coordination  challenges  can  arise from  short-term,  project-based  funding,  shifting  the  priorities  of donor  institutions  and  the  pressures  placed  on  human  resources  in the  receiving  nation  (Parsons  and  Nalau,  2019;  Nunn  et  al.,  2020). Innovative  policy  instruments,  such  as  concessional  loans,  tax-policy reforms,  climate  bonds  and  public-debt  forgiveness,  can  supplement traditional financial instruments (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018; McGowan et al., 2020). Mechanisms for solving the persistent problem of securing upfront  investments  for  coastal  protection  and  other  adaptation measures (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018; Moser et al., 2019; Kok et al., 2021) include  integrating  adaptation  investments  into  insurance  schemes (Reguero  et  al.,  2020)  and  using  debt  financing  to  bridge  the  time until benefits are realised (Ware and Banhalmi-Zakar, 2020). Insurance mechanisms  that  link  payments  to  losses  from  a  trigger  event  (e.g., MHW)  can  confer  resilience  to  marine-dependent  communities (Sumaila  et  al.,  2021). All  innovative  financial  instruments  are  most effective  when  they  are  inclusive  and  reach  vulnerable  groups  and marginalised  communities  (low  evidence,  high  agreement)  (Claudet et al., 2020a; Sumaila et al., 2021).Countries with large ocean areas within their EEZs have opportunities to  develop ‘blue–green  economies’  to  reduce  emissions  and  finance adaptation pathways (Chen et al., 2018a; Lee et al., 2020). Shifting from grants to results-based financing can help attract more private capital to  ocean  adaptation  (Lubchenco  et  al.,  2016;  Claudet  et  al.,  2020a). Public–private partnerships can also increase ocean adaptation finance (Goldstein et al., 2019; Sumaila et al., 2021). For example, the financial benefits  that  biodiversity  conservation  confers  to  seafood  harvest resilience could be used to leverage industry participation in adaptation and conservation finance (Barbier et al., 2018). Connecting restoration of  blue  carbon  ecosystems  with  offset  markets  (e.g.,  Vanderklift et  al.,  2019)  shows  potential,  but  uncertainties  remain  about  the international emissions trading under the UN Framework Convention on  Climate  Change  and  climate  impacts  on  blue  carbon  ecosystems (Section 3.6.3.1.6; Lovelock et al., 2017a; Macreadie et al., 2019).Transparency,  coherence  between  different  actors  and  initiatives,  and project  monitoring  and  evaluation  enhance  success  in  adapting  and achieving SDG14 (Life Below Water) (Blasiak et al., 2019). Maladaptation (WGII  Chapter  16;  Magnan  et  al.,  2016)  is  a  common  risk  of  current project-based  funding  due  to  the  pressure  to  produce  concrete  results (medium  confidence)  (Parsons  and  Nalau,  2019;  Nunn  et  al.,  2020; Nunn et al., 2021). Maladaptation can be avoided through a focus on building  adaptive  capacity,  community-based  management,  drivers  of vulnerability and site-specific measures (low confidence) (Magnan and Duvat, 2018; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Schipper, 2020). More research is needed to identify ways that governance and financing agreements can help overcome financial barriers and sociocultural constraints to avoid maladaptation  in  coastal  ecosystems  (high  confidence)  (Hinkel  et  al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Schipper, 2020).3.6.3.3.3  Governance dimension (institutional settings, decision making)Ocean governance has become increasingly complex as new initiatives, new  international  agreements,  institutions  and  scientific  evidence arise  at  global,  national  and  subnational  scales  (high  agreement) (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Scobie, 2019b), limiting the present effectiveness of  adaptation  (IPCC,  2019c).  Marine  climate  governance  is  within the  normatively  contested  marine  governance  space  (Frazão  Santos et al., 2020), which is influenced by geopolitics (Gray et al., 2020) and profit  maximisation  (Flannery  et  al.,  2016;  Haas  et  al.,  2021)  in  ways that  can  entrench  exclusionary  processes  in  decision  making,  science management  and  funding  (Levin  et  al.,  2018).  This  limits  just  and inclusive ocean governance (Bennett, 2018), perpetuates historical and cultural extractive practices and climate inaction, and leaves little space for Indigenous-led adaptation frameworks and approaches (Nursey-Bray 488Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3et al., 2019). At the national level, ocean governance for climate-change adaptation is often transversal, requiring consideration of biophysical and environmental conditions (Furlan et al., 2020) while fitting into existing economic  (Kim,  2020)  and  political  processes. Adaptation  governance that  couples  existing  top-down  structures  with  decentralised  and participatory  approaches  generates  shared  goals  and  unlocks  required resources and monitoring (Gupta et al., 2016; Haas et al., 2021).Communities and governments at all levels increasingly use decision-making  frameworks  (e.g.,  structured  decision  making)  or  decision-analysis  tools  to  evaluate  trade-offs  between  different  responses, rather  than  applying  generic  best  practices  to  different  physical, technical or cultural contexts (high confidence) (Watkiss et al., 2015; Haasnoot et al., 2019; Palutikof et al., 2019). Increased effort has also been devoted to developing climate services (actionable information and  data  products)  that  bridge  the  gap  between  climate  prediction and decision making (Hewitt et al., 2020). Climate services have the potential to inform decision making related to disaster-risk reduction, adaptation  responses,  marine  environmental  management  (e.g., fisheries  management  and  MPA  management)  and  ocean-based climate mitigation (e.g., renewable-energy installations) (Le Cozannet et  al.,  2017;  Gattuso  et  al.,  2019;  Gattuso  et  al.,  2021).  Although improving  observational  and  modelling  capacity  is  important  to developing  ocean-focused  services,  particularly  in  high-risk  regions like  SIDS  where  regional  climate  projections  are  scarce  (WGI  AR6 Chapter  9;  Morim  et  al.,  2019;  Fox-Kemper  et  al.,  2021),  data  are not the only limiting factor in decision making (Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019). Focusing on user engagement, relationship building and  the  decision-making  context  ensures  that  climate  services  are useful to, and used by, different stakeholders (high confidence) (Soares et  al.,  2018;  Mackenzie  et  al.,  2019; Weichselgartner  and Arheimer, 2019; Findlater et al., 2021; West et al., 2021).3.6.3.3.4  MitigationOcean  and  coastal  NbS  can  contribute  to  global  mitigation  efforts, especially  with  ocean  renewable  energy  and  restoration  and preservation  of  carbon  ecosystems  (see  Box  3.4;  Section  3.6.2.3). Technological,  economic  and  financing  barriers  presently  hamper development of renewable ocean energy (AR6 WGIII Chapter 6). Such development could help small nations reliant on imported fuel meet their  climate-mitigation  goals  and  decrease  risk  from  global  fuel-supply dynamics (Millar et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018a), but progress is limited by lack of investment (Millar et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2020) or equipment (Aderinto and Li, 2018; Rusu and Onea, 2018). Wave-energy installations,  possibly  co-located  with  wind  turbines  (Perez-Collazo et al., 2018), are promising for both low- to middle-income nations and areas with significant island or remote coastal geographies (Lavidas and Venugopal, 2016; Bergillos et al., 2018; Jakimavičius et al., 2018; Kompor  et  al.,  2018;  Penalba  et  al.,  2018;  Saprykina  and  Kuznetsov, 2018; Lavidas, 2019). Wave-energy capture may also diminish storm-induced coastal erosion (Abanades et al., 2018; Bergillos et al., 2018). Tidal energy is a relatively new technology (Haslett et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Neill et al., 2018) with limiting siting requirements (Mofor et al., 2013). Ocean renewable-energy expansion faces other technological obstacles including lack of implementable or scalable energy-capture devices,  access  to  offshore  sites,  competing  coastal  uses,  potential environmental  impacts  and  lack  of  power-grid  infrastructure  at  the coast (Aderinto and Li, 2018; Neill et al., 2018).3.6.4 Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals and Other Relevant Policy FrameworksThe impacts of climate change on ocean and coastal ecosystems and their  services  threaten  achievement  of  the  UN  SDGs  by  2030  (high confidence), particularly ocean targets (Table 3.31; Nilsson et al., 2016; Pecl et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018; Singh et al., 2019a; Claudet et al., 2020a). Nevertheless,  local  to  international  decision-making  bodies  have assigned the lowest priority to SDG14, Life Below Water (Nash et al., 2020).3.6.4.1 Climate Mitigation Effects on Ocean-Related SDGsSROCC  underscored  the  need  for  ambitious  mitigation  to  control climate hazards in the ocean to achieve SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement) (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Delays in achieving ocean-dependent SDGs observed in SROCC and SR15 can be addressed with ambitious planned adaptation and mitigation action (high agreement) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b). Since the ocean can contribute substantially to the attainment of mitigation targets aiming to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b), and to adaptation solutions facilitating attainment of social and economic SDGs, climate policy is treating the ocean less as a victim of climate change and more as a central participant in solving the  global  climate  challenge  (Cooley  et  al.,  2019;  Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a; Dundas et al., 2020).3impacts requires to  climate-change Relationships  between  Climate  Action  (SDG13)  targets  and  SDG14 targets  are  mostly  synergistic  (Figure  3.26;  Fuso  Nerini  et  al.,  2019). Responding transformative governance  (high  confidence)  (Chapters  1,  18;  Collins  et  al.,  2019a; Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020; Claudet et al., 2020a), especially for extreme events and higher-impact scenarios (e.g., higher emissions) (Fedele et al., 2019),  and  for  achieving  SDGs  through  one  of  the  global  ecosystems transitions (Chapter 18; Sachs et al., 2019; Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020). Opportunities to transform ocean governance exist in developing new international and local agreements, regulations and policies that reduce the  risks  of  relocating  ocean  and  coastal  activities  (Section  3.6.3.1.1) or  in  reinventing  established  practices  (Section  3.6.3.3.3).  Policy transformations improving ocean sustainability under SDG14 also help address SDG13 (Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020; Dundas et al., 2020; Claudet, 2021; Sumaila et al., 2021). Emergent situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,  may  provide  opportunities  to  implement  transformative ‘green recovery plans’ that support achievement of the SDGs and NDCs (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).3.6.4.2   Contribution of Ocean Adaptation to SDGsin  helping  achieve Marine-focused  adaptations  show  promise social  SDGs,  especially  when  they  are  designed  to  achieve  multiple benefits  (medium  confidence)  (Figure  3.26;  Ntona  and  Morgera, 2018;  Claudet  et  al.,  2020a). Technology-  and  infrastructure-focused adaptations  (Section  3.6.2.2)  can  help  relieve  coastal  communities 489Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their ServicesTable 3.31 |  Sustainable Development Goals, grouped into broader categories as discussed in this sectionaCategoryGoalSocietyEconomyEnvironmentGovernance(a) See http://sdgs.un.org/goalsSDG1: No PovertySDG2: Zero HungerSDG3: Good Health and Well-BeingSDG4: Quality EducationSDG5: Gender EqualitySDG6: Clean Water and SanitationSDG7: Affordable and Clean EnergySDG8: Decent Work and Economic GrowthSDG9: Industry, Innovation and InfrastructureSDG10: Reduced InequalitySDG11: Sustainable Cities and CommunitiesSDG12: Responsible Consumption and ProductionSDG13: Climate ActionSDG14: Life Below WaterSDG15: Life on LandSDG16: Peace and Justice Strong InstitutionsSDG17: Partnerships to Achieve the Goals3from  risks  associated  with  poverty  (SDG1),  hunger  (SDG2),  health and  water  sanitation  (SDG3  and  SDG6),  and  inequality  (SDG10)  by supporting  aquaculture  (Sections  3.5.3,  3.6.3.1),  alerting  the  public about poor water quality (Sections 3.5.5.3, 3.6.3.1) and empowering marginalised  groups,  such  as  women  and  Indigenous  Peoples,  with decision-relevant  information  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement) (Sections  3.5.5.3,  3.6.3.1).  Effectively  implemented  and  managed marine NbS (Section 3.6.2.3) contribute to attainment of social SDGs by:  (a)  preserving  biodiversity  (Carlton  and  Fowler,  2018;  Warner, 2018;  Scheffers  and  Pecl,  2019),  which  benefits  most  ocean  and coastal ecosystem services (Section 3.5.3; Figure 3.22); (b) increasing marine  fishery  and  aquaculture  sustainability  (Section  3.6.3);  (c) including  vulnerable  people  and  communities in  management (Section  3.6.3.2.1);  (d)  lowering  risk  of  flooding  from  storms  and SLR  (Cross-Chapter  Box  SLR  in  Chapter  3;  Sections  3.6.3.1.1);  and (e)  implementing  spatial-management  tools  that  make  room  for new  uses  like  renewable-energy  development  (Section  3.6.3.3.4). Nature-based  solutions  can  therefore  help  support  achievement  of No Poverty (SDG1) (Ntona and Morgera, 2018), Zero Hunger (SDG2), Good Health and Well-Being (SDG3) (Duarte et al., 2020), Affordable and  Clean  Energy  (SDG7)  (Fuso  Nerini  et  al.,  2019;  Levin  et  al., 2020)  and  Reduced  Inequality  (SDG10).  Socio-institutional  marine adaptations  (Section  3.6.2.2)  that  support  current  livelihoods  and help develop alternatives can contribute to attainment of social SDGs by  enhancing  social  equity  and  supporting  societal  transformation (medium confidence) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2019; Pelling and Garschagen,  2019;  Nash  et  al.,  2021).  Even  societal  changes  that are  not  directly  marine  related  can  decrease  human  vulnerability  to ocean and coastal climate risks by improving overall human adaptive capacity (Section 1.2).Marine adaptation also shows promise for helping support achievement of  economic  SDGs  (medium  confidence)  (Figure  3.26).  Marine  NbS could  help  blue-economy  frameworks  achieve  Decent  Work  and Economic Growth (SDG8) (Lee et al., 2020) by sustainably and equitably incorporating  ecosystem-based  fisheries  management,  restoration or  conservation  (Sections  3.6.3.1.2,  3.6.3.2.1,  3.6.3.2.2;  Voyer  et  al., 2018;  Cisneros-Montemayor  et  al.,  2019;  Cohen  et  al.,  2019;  Okafor-Yarwood  et  al.,  2020).  Nature-based  solutions  that  involve  active restoration or accommodation can contribute to Sustainable Cities and Communities  (SDG11)  and  Infrastructure  (SDG9)  (Section  3.6.3.1.1). Newly  developed  marine  industries  and  livelihoods  associated  with NbS  might  support  attainment  of  Sustainable  Communities  (SDG11) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2019). Finance and market mechanisms to  support  disaster  relief  or  ocean  ecosystem  services,  such  as  blue carbon  or  food  provisioning,  and  innovations  (SDG9)  including  new technologies  like  vessel-monitoring  systems  (Kroodsma  et  al.,  2018), can  contribute  to  Responsible  Consumption  and  Production  (SDG12) (Sumaila and Tai, 2020). Blue-economy growth that includes sustainable shipping, tourism, renewable ocean energy and transboundary fisheries management (Pinsky et al., 2018) have the potential to contribute to Economic Development (SDG8), affordable and clean energy (SDG7) as well as global mitigation efforts (SDG13) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b; Duarte  et  al.,  2020).  Participatory  approaches  and  co-management systems (Section 3.6.2.1) in many maritime sectors can contribute to SDG11 and SDG12 while helping align the blue economy and the SDGs (high agreement) (Lee et al., 2020; Okafor-Yarwood et al., 2020).Developing marine adaptation pathways that offer multiple benefits requires  transformational  adaptation  (high  confidence)  (Claudet et al., 2020a; Friedman et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2020b; Nash et al., 2021)  that  avoids  risky  and  maladaptive  actions  (Magnan  and Duvat,  2018;  Ojea  et  al.,  2020).  Ocean  and  coastal  extreme  events and  other  hazards  disproportionately  harm  the  most  vulnerable communities  in  SIDS,  tropical  and  Arctic  regions,  and  Indigenous Peoples (Chapter 8.2.1.2). Presently implemented adaptation activity, at the aggregate level, adversely affects multiple gender targets under SDG5 (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). Although women make up over half of the global seafood production workforce (fishing and processing sectors), provide more than half the artisanal landings in the Pacific region (Harper et al., 2013), dominate some seafood sectors such as seaweed (Howard and Pecl, 2019) and 490Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3Synergies and trade-offs between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Climate Action(13), Life Below Water (14), and social, economic and governance SDGsClimateaction(SDG13)toSDG14SDG14 to Social SDGs1GDS2GDS3GDS4GDS5GDS6GDS7GDSSDG14 to Economic SDGs8GDS9GDS01GDS11GDS21GDSSDG14 toGovernance SDGs61GDS71GDSSDG14: Life Below Water targets14.1.

Achieving SDG13 provides positive outcomes and supports the achievement of all SDG14 targets. In turn, meeting SDG14 drives mostly positive interactions with social, economic and governance SDGs. The interaction types, ‘Indivisible’ (inextricably linked to the achievement of another goal), ‘Reinforcing’ (aids the achievement of another goal), ‘Enabling’ (creates conditions that further another goal), ‘Consistent’ (no significant positive or negative interactions) and ‘Constraining’ (limits options on another goal), follow Nilsson et al.’s (2016) scoring system based on the authors’ assessment, and agreement denotes consistency across author ratings. (Full data are available in Table 3.SM.7.)3shellfish  harvesting  (Turner  et  al.,  2020a)  and  account  for  11%  of global artisanal fisheries participants (Harper et al., 2020b), they are often not specifically counted in datasets and excluded from decision making  and  support  programmes  (Cross-Chapter  Box  GENDER  in Chapter  18;  Harper  et  al.,  2020b;  Michalena  et  al.,  2020). Targeted efforts  to  incorporate  knowledge  diversity,  and  include  artisanal fishers, women and Indigenous Peoples within international, regional and  local  policy  planning,  promote  marine  adaptation  that  supports achievement  of  gender  equality  (SDG5)  and  reduces  inequalities (SDG10)  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement)  (FAO,  2015).  Integrated planning,  financing  and  implementation  can  help  overcome  these limitations in Chapter  17),  ensuring  that  marine  adaptations  do  not  compromise overall human equity or specific SDGs (Österblom et al., 2020; Nash et al., 2021), but are in fact fully synergistic with these goals (Bennett et al., 2021).(Section  3.6.3.3.2;  Cross-Chapter  Box  FINANCE 3.6.4.3 Relevant Policy Frameworks for Ocean AdaptationThe  intricacy,  scope,  time  scales  and  uncertainties  associated  with climate  change  challenge  ocean  governance,  which  already  is extremely  complex  because  it  encompasses  a  variety  of  overlapping spatial scales, concerns and governance structures (see Figure CB3.1 in SROCC Chapter 1; Prakash et al., 2019). Assessment of how established global agreements and regional, sectoral or scientific bodies address climate  adaptation  and  resilience,  and  how  current  practices  can  be improved, is found in SM3.5.3.There  is  growing  momentum  to  include  the  ocean  in  international climate policy (robust evidence), paving the way for a more integrated approach  to  both  mitigation  and  adaptation.  Following  adoption  of the  Paris  Agreement  in  2015,  the  UN  SDGs  (Table  3.31)  came  into force  in  2016,  including  SDG14  specifically  dedicated  to  Life  Below Water (Table 3.31). In 2017, the first UN Ocean Conference was held (United Nations, 2017), the UNFCCC adopted the Ocean Pathway to increase  ocean-targeted  multilateral  climate  action  (COP23,  2017) and  the  UN  Assembly  declared  2021–2030  the  Decade  for  Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Visbeck, 2018; Lee et al., 2020). Next, 14 world leaders formed the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy to produce the New Ocean Action Agenda, founded on 100% sustainable management of national ocean spaces by 2025 (Ocean Panel, 2020). All of these initiatives position oceans centrally within  the  climate-policy  and  biodiversity-conservation  landscapes and  seek  to  develop  a  coherent  effort  and  common  frameworks  to achieve  marine  sustainability  (Visbeck,  2018;  Lee  et  al.,  2020),  new economic opportunities (Konar and Ding, 2020; Lee et al., 2020), more equitable  outcomes  (Österblom  et  al.,  2020)  and  decisive  climate mitigation and adaptation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a), to achieve truly transformative change (Claudet et al., 2020a).There is high confidence in the literature that multilateral environmental integration  to  support agreements  need  better  alignment  and achievement of ambitious international development, climate mitigation and adaptation goals (Swilling et al., 202; Duarte et al., 2020; Friedman et al., 2020; Conservation International and IUCN, 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021b; Sumaila et al., 2021). The ocean targets of the CBD (e.g., the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework), the SDGs (Agenda 2030) and the Paris Agreement are already inclusive and synergistic (Duarte et al., 2020). However, specific policy instruments and sectors within them could be additionally integrated, especially to address such cross-cutting impacts 491 3Chapter 3 Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Servicesas  ocean  acidification  and  deoxygenation  (Gallo  et  al.,  2017;  Bindoff et  al.,  2019a),  increasing  plastic  pollution  (Ostle  et  al.,  2019;  Duarte et al., 2020), high-seas governance (Johnson et al., 2019; Leary, 2019) or deep-sea uses (Wright et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2020; Orejas et al., 2020). National adaptation plans present opportunities to synergistically build on mitigation to support equitable development (Morioka et al., 2020), economic  planning  (Dundas  et  al.,  2020;  Lee  et  al.,  2020)  and  ocean stewardship  (von  Schuckmann  et  al.,  2020). Alignment  of  multilateral agreements is expected to increase mitigation impact as well as increase adaptation  options  (Section  3.6.3;  Figure  3.25;  Roberts  et  al.,  2020). Opportunities  to  improve  multilateral  environmental  agreements  and policies beyond UNFCCC and CBD processes are discussed in SM3.5.3, and an assessment of commercial species-management initiatives and needs is in Chapter 5.3.6.5  Emerging Best Practices for Ocean and Coastal Climate AdaptationThere is robust evidence that a combination of global and local solutions offers the greatest benefit in reducing climate risk (Gattuso et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b). Ambitious and swift global mitigation offers more adaptation options and pathways to sustain ecosystems and their services (Figure 3.25). Some solutions target both mitigation and adaptation (e.g., blue carbon conservation; Cross-Chapter  Box  NATURAL  in  Chapter  2;  see  Box  3.4),  and  cross-cutting solutions simultaneously support several ocean-related sectors (e.g., area-based measures support fishing, tourism; Section 3.6.3.2.1) or ecosystem functions (e.g., NbS support coastal protection, biodiversity, habitat,  etc.;  Section  3.6.3.2.2;  Sala  et  al.,  2021).  Combined  solutions also  leverage  a  variety  of  existing  policies  and  governance  systems (Section 3.6.4.3; Duarte et al., 2020) to advance climate mitigation and adaptation.  Even  communities  that  face  the  limits  of  adaptation,  like those  who  must  relocate  to  cope  with  rising  seas  (McMichael  et  al., 2019;  Bronen  et  al.,  2020),  urgently  require  solutions  that  combine scientific projections, IKLK, cultural and community values, and ways to preserve  cultural  identity  to  support  planning  and  implementation  of relocation (McMichael and Katonivualiku, 2020).Nature-based  solutions  are  showing  promising  results  in  achieving adaptation  and  mitigation  outcomes  across  marine  and  coastal ecosystems  (Sections  3.6.3.2.1–3.6.3.2.2),  but  NbS  have  different degrees of readiness in marine ecosystems (Duarte et al., 2020). Habitat restoration  and  recovery  are  highly  effective  in  specific  settings  and conditions  (McLeod  et  al.,  2019).  Restoring  and  conserving  vegetated coastal  habitats  (Sections  3.4.2.4–3.4.2.5)  represent  robust  NbS, especially in the tropics, and particularly when paired with restoration and conservation of terrestrial ecosystems (robust evidence) (e.g., peatlands and forests; WGIII AR6 Chapter 7; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b; Duarte et al., 2020; Griscom et al., 2020). Although most of the focus on NbS efficacy  has  been  on  coastal  and  shelf  ecosystems  (Section  3.6.3.2), recent advances point to an emerging role of NbS beyond coastal waters in the form of area-based management tools in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (Section 3.6.2.3; Gaines et al., 2018; Pinsky et al., 2018; Crespo et al., 2020; O’Leary et al., 2020; Visalli et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2020), because sustainable fisheries and aquaculture and climate-responsive MPAs have high potential to adapt (Tittensor et al., 2019).Adaptation  efforts  (Sections  3.6.3.1–3.6.3.2)  have  three  common characteristics  that  facilitate implementation  and  success,  and contribute  to  climate  resilient  development  pathways  (Chapter  18). First,  availability  of  multiple  types  of  information  (e.g.,  monitoring, models, climate services; Section 3.6.3.3) exposes the magnitude and nature  of  the  adaptation  challenge. Well-developed  observation  and modelling capabilities (Reusch et al., 2018) offer insights on climate-associated risks at different time scales (Cvitanovic et al., 2018; Hobday et  al.,  2018),  and  this  facilitates  adaptation  within  multiple  areas (e.g., industries over shorter time scales, societies over longer scales) (Hobday  et  al.,  2018).  Environmental  data  have  supported  building societal  and  political  (socio-institutional)  will  to  adopt  national  and subnational  adaptive  management  principles  (Hobday  et  al.,  2016b; Champion et al., 2018; McDonald et al., 2019). However, incorporating IKLK  at  the  same  time  provides  more  diverse  social–environmental insight (Section 3.6.3.4.1; Goeldner-Gianella et al., 2019; Petzold and Magnan, 2019; Wilson et al., 2020b). This can help align adaptation solutions  with  cultural  values  and  increase  their  legitimacy  with Indigenous and local communities (Chapter 1.3.2.3), achieving climate resilient development pathways (Chapter 18; Adger et al., 2017; Nalau et al., 2018; Peñaherrera-Palma et al., 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel,  2018; Wamsler  and  Brink,  2018).  Second,  implementation  of multiple low-risk options (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a; Gattuso et al., 2021) such as economic diversification (Section 3.6.2.1) can provide culturally  acceptable  livelihood  alternatives  and  food  supplies  (e.g., fishing to ecotourism and mariculture) (Froehlich et al., 2019) while also providing environmental benefits (e.g., seaweed mariculture’s potential carbon  storage  co-benefits)  (WGIII AR6  Chapter  7;  Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a; Gattuso et al., 2021). Third, inclusive governance that is well aligned to the systems at risk from climate change is fundamental for effective adaptation (Barange et al., 2018). Solutions implemented within  polycentric  governance  systems  (Section  3.6.3;  Bellanger et  al.,  2020)  benefit  from  synergies  between  knowledge,  action  and social–ecological  contexts  and  stimulate  governance  responses  at appropriate  spatio-temporal  scales  (Cvitanovic  and  Hobday,  2018). Governance  aligned  with  Indigenous  structures  and  local  structures supports  successful  outcomes  that  prioritise  the  concerns  and  rights of involved communities (Section 3.6.3; Mawyer and Jacka, 2018) and better leverages existing social organisation (i.e., network structures), learning processes and power dynamics (Barnes et al., 2020).There is an opportunity to improve current practices when developing new ocean and coastal adaptation efforts so that they routinely contain these  successful  characteristics  and  resolve  technical,  economic, institutional, geophysical, ecological and social constraints (Figure 3.25; Section  3.6.3.3;  IPCC,  2018;  Singh  et  al.,  2020).  Enhancements  are needed  in  human,  technical  and  financial  resources;  regulatory frameworks  (Ojwang  et  al.,  2017);  political  support  (Rosendo  et  al., 2018); institutional conditions and resources for fair governance (Gupta et al., 2016; Scobie, 2018); political leadership; stakeholder engagement; multidisciplinary data availability (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018); funding and  public  support  for  adaptation  (Cross-Chapter  Box  FINANCE  in Chapter  17;  Ford  and  King,  2015);  and  incorporating  IKLK  in  decision making (Nalau et al., 2018; Jabali et al., 2020; Petzold et al., 2020). As climate change continues to challenge ocean and coastal regions, there is  high  confidence  associated  with  the  benefits  of  developing  robust, equitable  adaptation  strategies  that  incorporate  scientific  projections, 492Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services  Chapter 3employ portfolios of low-risk options, internalise IKLK and address social aspects  of  governance  from  international  to  local  scales  (Finkbeiner et al., 2018; Gattuso et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018; Cheung et al., 2019; Gattuso et al., 2021).AcknowledgementsWe  acknowledge  the  kind  contributions  of  Rita  Erven  (GEOMAR Helmholtz  Centre  for  Ocean  Research  Kiel,  Germany),  Miriam Seifert  (Alfred  Wegener  Institute  for  Polar  and  Marine  Research, Germany),  Sebastian  Rokitta  (Alfred  Wegener  Institute  for  Polar and  Marine  Research,  Germany),  Amy  Marie  Campbell  (National Oceanography  Centre,  Southampton/Centre for  Environment, Fisheries  and Aquaculture  Science,  UK),  Mariana  Castaneda-Guzman (Virginia  Polytechnic  Institute  and  State  University,  USA),  Stephen Goult  (Plymouth  Marine  Laboratory/National  Centre  for  Earth Observation,  UK),  Josh  Douglas  (Plymouth  Marine  Laboratory,  UK), Carl Reddin (Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany) and the PML Communications  and  Graphics  Team  (Plymouth  Marine  Laboratory, UK) who assisted in drafting figures and tables.3493Chapter 3 ReferencesOceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services3Aalto,  E.A.,  et  al.,  2019:  Catastrophic  mortality,  allee  effects,  and  marine protected areas.
