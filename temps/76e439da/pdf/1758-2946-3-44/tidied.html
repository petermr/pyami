In order to appreciate those origins,we start by describing the backgrounds and motivationsof the present authors (Endnote 1) (Figure 1).PMR recounts the early background to CML from hispoint of view: “What are the origins of CML? I think Igo back to ca. 1980 when I was writing code to extendSam Motherwell’s great FORTRAN toolkit for the Cam-bridge database [1]- BIBSER (bibliographic search),CONNSER - the first and greatest chemical substructurealgorithm, and GEOM78 - a geometry calculation tool.Between 1977 and 1980 I used to visit Cambridge (fromStirling) and work with Sam on extracting structuresfrom the database and analysing them (Figure 2). Therewas a rough division of labour and ideas between us. Icame with a number of ideas and Sam would modifyCONNSER and GEOM to support these - literallywithin a day or so.I took the problems back to Stirling and “integrated”Sam’s output with SPSS [2]. I did the analysis on thefloor of our living room with an acoustic modem [3]where the handset was plugged into rubber cups. Itused to run at 110 baud. The sums were originally doneat Cambridge (on Phoenix) but I ported the software toatUMRCC (the Regional Computing Centre* Correspondence: pm286@cam.ac.uk1Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, Department of Chemistry,Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UKFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleManchester) on a CDC 7600. The results were printedout on folding line printer paper on a boustrophedonicASR33 teletype. I would then extract data by hand andenter them into the statistical programs, but graduallymoved to doing the statistics remotely. Remote graphicswas always difficult - we could get printer plots postedfrom Aberdeen but it took a week. So I generallyevolved ASCII (line printer output) plots. One conse-quence is that during these sessions I had a lot of timeto think about how to do it better. It was obvious thesoftware had to be modular and I gradually got to think-ing about modular data.In 1981/2 I spent a sabbatical with Jenny Glusker [4]in Philadelphia and there developed a VAX-VMS ver-sion of the software. I extended this to plot aggregationsof data in two and three dimensions. Again the idea ofmodular components was clear. I returned to start upmolecular modelling/computer graphics in Glaxo andfound myself working with a completely different set ofdata files -ChemX, MDL molfile, etc. I couldn’t usethese with my analysis code. This burgeoning of porta-ble chemical computational systems had began in theearly 1980s with a number of software products, mainlycodes but also datafiles, being developed for the molecu-lar graphics and computational chemistry community.In general, each resource developed its own representa-tion of information, often referred to as a ‘file format’ or‘file type’. For example, by the mid 1980s there wereprobably fifty different file formats in chemistry includ-ing PDB, CSSR, MDL molfile and more specific programoutputs [5] (Endnote 2). It was a major problem to con-vert between these formats, but despite some initiativesmany software producers regarded the formats as pro-prietary and were resistant to ideas of inter-operability.It seemed completely wasteful not to have a commonformat, so I started an activity within the MolecularGraphics Society [6] to systematize file types.

Remove this libraryand the hardware, and my (FORTRAN) programbecame very difficult to port (especially to the rasterdevices which were starting to replace the vector dis-plays in the mid 1980s). It did teach me the value ofmarkup (I was already used to word processing usingtroff [9]), of separating data elements into modular com-ponents, and in particular of stateless “round tripping”,the ability to generate the output of a session in either ahuman- or a machine-readable manner that could beread back without loss, and in a reasonably error toler-ant fashion, or with some components re-used for a dif-ferent context. These absorbed concepts re-emergedsome 10 years later when the ideas for CML startedcirculating.I think my STEK program lasted perhaps 12 years,since I found that even in 1989, I was still using it[10,11] (good examples can be found in Figure one andFigures three &amp; four respectively of these publications,which are not reproduced here for reasons of copyright).The molecule renderer had one feature unique to MOcalculations not found in ORTEP, i.e. the ability to dis-play the vibrational displacement vectors for a transitionstate, which was essential for understanding potentialenergy surfaces and the stationary points located.The history of molecular orbital rendering is in itselfan interesting one, since it introduces the connectionbetween data, and its most effective representation.Hückel [12,13] was the first to apply MOs to “interest-ing molecules” such as benzene, but he famously nevershowed any diagrams. Dewar, starting in the early1950s, did much to promote the use of molecular orbi-tals as a conceptual tool in chemistry, but he rarely pro-vided quantitative representations in his articles. Thegreat era of PMO theory in the 1950s was describedusing largely equations and tabulations of numbersrather than images [14]. Whilst I was a post doc withDewar from 1974-1977, the group never in my recollec-tion included MO wavefunctions derived using a graphi-cal computer program in its publications! There was noidea to enhance the group’s papers with such fromDewar himself, or the spark from anyone in the groupto go find such a program (from e.g. QCPE [15] (ifindeed any existed)). I introduced routine ORTEP plot-ting of molecular coordinates to the group’s output, butnever myself made the jump to rendering wavefunctionsuntil inspired by an article on “orbital photography” in1984 [16].The relevance of MO rendering is that it highlightedin my mind the importance of data (calculated MOcoefficients as numbers) and the need to interpret themFigure 1 The PMRz symbiote in a familiar environment.this was an attempt to build a chemical ontology. Ididn’t get much take up and there was active resistancefrom some software companies who regarded their for-mats as a commercial weapon.During this period I had gradually advanced my lan-guage skills from FORTRAN to BBC-BASIC and C (partof this was through teaching the MSc in Birkbeck). Sowhen C++ came along (late 1980s) I translated myapproach to C++ and started to develop a toolkit/library.That’s effectively when CML as a data modellingapproach started.”HSR recalls his own early experiences in writing mod-ular code: “In 1977, I had returned from the USA toImperial College to continue my researches in quantummechanical molecular modelling. Whilst at Austin inMichael Dewar’s group, where I was learning about thisarea, I had encountered the famous ORTEP [7] programfor displaying images derived from molecular coordi-nates, overkill of course for what I needed. So in 1977,armed with a Tektronix 4014 vector graphics terminal[8], I started to write a simplified molecular renderer(STEK) optimized for computational chemistry usingFORTRAN code. A number of modules were aggre-gated, including a much simplified ORTEP-style mole-cular renderer with an appropriately semi-interactiveinterface for rotating the molecule into an effective pro-jection, simple XY plotting routines, 2D contour andisometric plotting routines for potential energy surfacesand molecular orbitals, and various labelling and anno-tating routines. Data was read in from separate files(mostly the output of the MOPAC molecular orbitalprogram) and written out into a (human- readable) sin-gle history file which could be used to restore the com-posite diagram. To separate the various data types, Ideveloped a simple, rather ad hoc markup language,with a linear parser which could read back the dataobjects and associated display attributes to reconstructthe content model for the diagram.

This hasevolved into the bond length analysis tool in CrystalEye [60] which allows interactive clicking of points to bring up structures. (Note: Image is ascan of the original line printer output).semantically (which only visual rendering can do), inother words, the importance of both data and its appro-priate rendering. Dewar’s group could do the former,but never developed the expertise for the latter. Interest-ingly, Hoffmann’s group did both, and acquired a majorreputation in the field, including of course the Nobelprize for interpretations of pericyclic reactions [17].Dewar always lamented his missing out on the Nobelprize, and arguably it was his inefficent application ofdata that might have been to blame.One might argue that the reason the computationaland the synthetic chemistry communities rarely mixedat that time is that the learning curve to understandingthe tables of numbers that were being produced in theo-retical articles was too steep for synthetic chemists. Per-haps images were also needed for impact? In 1984, theRubinstein brothers developed ChemDraw (a 2D repre-sentational program), followed in 1986 by Chem3D, tobe used at that time only on an overtly graphical com-puter (the Macintosh). This was one of a bevy of com-mercial programs of that era that started to addressbothand modellingcommunities.”chemistryorganictheBack to PMR: “However the crystallographers had amuch more unified view of the world. I continue tocongratulate the International Union of Crystallography(IUCr) for its efforts in this area. In the mid 1980s thecrystallographic community started to formalise itsapproach to small molecule X-ray diffraction. There wasan active group, led by David Brown [18] aiming to cre-ate a self-defining format for crystallography- StandardCrystallographic File Structure[19,20]. It was essentiallya data dictionary where a controlled vocabulary was cre-ated and specific semantics were added to items (e.g.data type). This approach was then taken further by thebirth of the CIF initiative in 1990 and CIF is now theMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 4 of 15standard method of exchanging crystallographic infor-mation [21]. This was based on data supported by datadictionaries which themselves were constrained to a dic-tionary definition specification. I started to use the CIFapproach to model my scientific world - this was longbefore XML but it was essentially isomorphic to XML -and it inspired much of the vision of CML.I started with the most obvious components - geome-try and numbers. These are still an integral part of CML(the “euclid“ library). This was then extended tomolecules, atoms and bonds and by ca. 1993 I had a setof objects. But I needed a way to display and manipulatethem.At that stage I met Henry Rzepa. Henry remembersthat probably around1993, the student chemical societyat Imperial College invited me to give a talk. I chose thetopic of crystallography, but in characteristic fashion,delivered a scintillating talk (Henry’s description!) cover-ing, well, probably almost all of chemistry! Henrychatted to me after my talk, and one of us must havementioned the Internet. The topic might have beengophers (anyone remember them?) and what theirpotential was. Henry also visited me at Glaxo in Green-ford around that time and we found we had a commoninterest in the Internet and its power for disseminatingchemistry. It must have been about the time of theNCSA Mosaic browser [22] - 1993. This, in both ourmemories, is now immortalised by our working meetingin the Black Horse pub in Greenford in January 1994(Figure 3). I had made initial explorations into a com-mon format for chemistry, but it was the major adop-tion of HTML in 1993 and the announcement of thefirst World-Wide-Web conference (WWW1)[23] in1994 that demonstrated that there was by then a criticalmass of scientists and informaticians who wished to cre-ate semantic frameworks for information.”In the Black Horse, PMR and HSR agreed they wouldboth attend the WWW1 meeting; HSR ran the sessionon chemistry and PMR one on biology. PMR: “We hadan early version of RasMol [24] which ran on UNIX andHenry had prepared a demo, parts of which were even-tually published [25]. We had it running the day beforeon a Silicon Graphics machine, but when we came backthe next day someone had wiped the shared libraries tosave space. We got the thing running again 5 minutesafter Henry’s talk [26] started.The theme of WWW1 was, of course, the use ofHTML (and HTTP) to create distributed information.Initially the focus was on HTML (with some discussionof the then very new MathML proposal by Raggett[27]), but during breakout sessions (or BoFs, birds-of-a-feather, as they were then called)[28] there emerged arealisation that each discipline would need to create itsown approach to information that would be publishedand consumed in much the same way as HTML.Because it was in CERN and all HTTP sites at thatstage were academic, the emphasis was all on science.Was MathML the way to carry maths in HTML? And ifso, how could you do the same for chemistry? Wedidn’t know how.”The WWW2 conference (Chicago, October 1994) hada focus on the development of the HTML markup lan-guage and was noteworthy for the attendance of non-scientists and many commercial organisations, as well asa representation from chemists [29]. It also served toconvince HSR that SGML [30] was the vehicle thatwould be adopted for non-textual information. As aresult, PMR started implementing prototypes of chemi-cal information using SGML and Tcl. At that stageSGML was complex and fragmented, to the extent thatrelatively few (if any) complete implementations existed.There were very few Open Source implementations andwe were grateful to be able to use the nsglms parser[31] from James Clark which would take an SGMLdocument and transform it into a structured representa-tion (ESIS). At the same time, a COST project, withFigure 3 The Black Horse pub at Greenford.Murray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 5 of 15help from Joe English, allowed the ESIS to be processedin essentially the way that is now possible with theDOM [32], and PMR received much online help andguidance from Joe. By 1995, there was a prototype sys-tem where it was possible to read an early version ofCML into a Tcl/Tk/COST processor and to display thestructure of a molecule (Figure 4).HSR recalls: “Checking through some ancient (sic)files on our web server, I discovered that we first wentpublic with CML on 21 August 1995, in the form of anACS poster [33]. I notice that it introduced the conceptof what I had referred to earlier to as data round trip-ping. The idea was to formalise and normalise both theinput and output of a computer program so that the lat-ter could also reliably serve as an input. This was in factimplemented for the MOPAC program, and was a muchmore formal and structured expression of what I hadearlier tried to do with the STEK graphical program. Iwas in Chicago, and Peter was back in the UK, at aterminal, waiting for comments from the audience onthe poster to come flooding in! In fact, when we got tothe hotel room that the ACS session occurred in, wediscovered no trace of any Internet connection (any-where) and could not communicate (Internet connec-tions at conference venues only started becomingcommon from ~2006 onwards). Peter satin anunrequited silence throughout the entire presentation!The poster was in fact presented as part of a sessiongrandly entitled “Chemistry on the Infobahn”.In 1995, HSR, PMR and Andrew Payne set up theOpen Molecular Foundation (OMF) as a group to sup-port and disseminate the creation of semantic chemistryusing CML (SGML) as the infrastructure. This stillrequired the combined operation of SGML processorexecutable and a wrapper which was being converted toJava 1.02. In late 1996, we became aware of the W3CXML project [34] (SGML on the Web) and joined theearly discussion and working groups, one of which wasFigure 4 Early CML markup, ca. 1995. Many of the current concepts were prototyped at this level, such as the CONVENTION andDICTNAME (now dictRef). The BUILTIN attribute is now hard-coded as CML attributes. The XVAR notation has now become cml:scalar and all the elements and attribute values have become QNames.

There, JonBosak [35] declared that Java and XML were the foun-dations of the web! It became clear at this stage thatCML should be based on XML, not SGML, and PMRwas now working to an XML/Java representation in1997 (Figure 5). A forum for XML developers was setup, which went live in February 1997 with a welcomepost by PMR, and where many of the important devel-opments involving XML were first discussed during theperiod of the operation of the list at its initial home(February 1997-December 1998) [36].The philosophy of CMLThe primary purpose of CML has been and is to allowhumans and machines to communicate chemical con-cepts without loss of semantic information. For example,a major role is to allow the output of one program to beconverted into CML and input to another without loss.CML is also designed to create datuments, a combina-tion of semantic text and non-textual information [37].Our vision is that scientific publications should berepresented semantically such that both humans andmachines can consume them, again without loss. WhenCML is universally adopted for both these processes,then the large parts of the current discourse and infor-mation interchange in chemistry will be semantic. Thereis no reason why CML, in combination with other lan-guages such as HTML, MathML, SVG, GML etc. (Figure6) cannot then be used for at least the following:(cid:129) Ingestion of data into data- and knowledge-bases(cid:129) Extraction of data from knowledge-bases(cid:129) Journal articles(cid:129) Theses(cid:129) Suppliers catalogues(cid:129) Textbooks(cid:129) Regulatory documents such as patents and newdrug applications(cid:129) Input to programs(cid:129) Output from programs.The only technology capable of managing this at pre-sent (and probably for some time to come) is XML. It iswidely used in publishing and CML can therefore betechnically adopted for any of the document-like exam-ples above. XML is also a primary method of marshal-ling input to databases and there are many tools whichallow the construction of db schemas from XML sche-mas. In addition, however, CML has also shown itself tobe valuable in the following areas:(cid:129) A semantic infrastructure for physical science.This is because none of the other scientific disci-plines have developed markup support for diction-aries and units and so the CML constructs cansupport other areas.(cid:129) A data structure for computation. Although notoriginally intended for this purpose, XML is a verypowerful data structure for internal data in compu-ter programs (with some possible sacrifice in perfor-mance and memory size). Many of our programs useCML as their complete data representation andoperate by adding to, removing from or modifyinginformation on the DOM or infoset. For many appli-cations this is a cleaner approach to passing data aseverything is contained within one structure andthere is no need for alternative storage of the sameFigure 5 JUMBO screenshots (ca. 1997) showing support for spectra, properties, molecular structure in 2D and 3D and a variety ofapplets and widgets. Note the considerable change in syntax from the earlier picture; we have prototyped a namespace approach (e.g. XML.*and CML.*). These were later separated into CML and STMML [61]. The molecules and spectra had clickable locations so that peaks andmolecules could be linked.

This was before the XML Working Group createdthe current namespace syntax and while CML was still based on DTDs. (Note: Image is a scan of an original overhead transparency).information. This, for example, is how all informa-tion in Chem4Word [38] and JUMBO [39] is held.(cid:129) A computable object in its own right. Because itis extensible and because computational semanticscan be added to some of the elements, it representsa simple functional programming language. This ismost developed in PolymerML [40] where a polymercan contain instructions for its own elaboration andMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 8 of 15the computation is carried out by repeatedly apply-ing polymer extension semantics to the PML repre-sentation of the structure.In designing CML, we have attempted to abstract thecurrent common implicit and explicit concepts in main-stream chemistry. This is done by intensive andrepeated analysis of chemical corpus linguistics. A com-mon procedure is to take a recent journal article and tosee to what extent CML can support the chemical con-cepts in that article. Similarly, we take the input andoutput of chemical programs and abstract new conceptsand dictionary entries from those. In this way, webelieve that CML is accessible to the chemical worldand other scientists who use chemistry without a changein their concept structure.The evolution of CMLDuring the evolution of CML, we have been guided bythe following factors:(cid:129) The evolution of W3C recommendations andweb technology and practice. For example, whenW3C introduced the XSD schema [41] recommen-dation we translated the CML DTD into XSD.When W3C introduced the XSLT [42] specification,we created a library of routines to process most ofthe CML elements. In similar ways, CML hasreacted to incorporate SVG, RDF and OWL. Thesetechnologies themselves have had variable amountsof uptake. For example, until recently the mainapplication of SVG was in mobile devices only, butnow, 10 years after its launch, it is becoming main-stream in most browsers. We created an early Java-script tool (JUMBO-JS) which ran in the two currentbrowsers in 2000 but which because of the rapidand uncontrolled changes in browser functionalityno longer works and has been abandoned. However,it appears that JS is now reborn in a stable imple-mentation and it is possible that we shall shortly cre-ate a CML reference. Similarly it has taken at least adecade for the concepts of RDF to mature and for asatisfactory toolset to start to appear. In these cases,CML had had to wait until there are clearly estab-lished and widely-used technologies that it can relyupon.(cid:129) The interest of chemistry and the wider scienti-fic community in markup languages. Chemistry isrecognised to be one of the more conservative scien-tific disciplines [43] and a new technology generallyrequires wide acceptance in other communities firstor a powerful and determined commercial imple-mentation. Although our work is well-known in thechemical informatics community, it is often said that“there is no demand for CML from our customers”with the result that a vicious circle ensues. Indeedsome of the impetus comes from other subjects suchas bioscience.(cid:129) The Open Source (OS) community. The OScommunity in chemistry is a relatively small part ofthe volume of software creation but it is highly visi-ble and has a wide variety of offerings. Almost allOS chemical systems can read and/or write CMLand there is a general agreement that these systemsshould converge to inter-operability. With theincreasing rise of OS in general, and specifically inchemistry, this will be an important incentive to theadoption of CML.(cid:129) Specific market applications. The publishingindustry is universally based on SGML and/or XMLand so it is technically straightforward to incorporateCML in publications. The movement away fromnon-semantic output (such as PDF) is still slow butwe believe that this is inevitable and again this willcreate considerable incentive to use CML. The smallproportion of Open Access (OA) in chemistrymeans that it is very uncommon for scientists toextractinformation from the literature usingmachines and indeed many publishers expressly for-bid this. As OA increases, we expect that the valueof semantic information extracted from the literaturewill be seen to provide a large amount of additionalvalue.(cid:129) Toolset. The chemistry community is likely torequire a range of well-proven tools before it willadopt a new information technology. This takes timeand/or financial investment before there is a per-ceived demand, but we believe that we are close to asituation where the value of this is starting tobecome apparent.(cid:129) Regulatory and archiving. There are several prac-tices where XML is the recommended approach. Inarchiving material, XML can represent the semanticsof a document and is frequently used by electronicarchivists. In regulatory there is a requirement formany regulators to know the precise details of infor-mation in the doc and to be able to extract itrapidly. Therefore again XML is frequently requiredby regulators. Both of these pressures should leadtowards a greater acceptance of CML.JUMBOIt has always been important that CML can be imple-mented in a reproducible and validatable manner. Weare extremely reluctant to allow new elements or attri-butes in CML unless it can be demonstrated that theycan be implemented and deployed in a large number ofuse cases without problems. It is surprising how oftenMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 9 of 15apparently small changes can severely disrupt thegreater system. For example, allowing the explicitlydeclaration delimiter = ‘ ‘ as the delimiter forarrays and matrix elements, although apparently simple,has proved to be unworkable because of XML’s normali-sation of whitespace. We have therefore has to redesignthe way in which the whitespace delimiter is used. Simi-larly in several cases we have used alternative values(such as 1 or S for single bonds) and this has resulted ina great deal of work and confusion. We use a depreca-tion mechanism to indicate that the reference imple-mentations may cease to support outdated syntax. Forthis reason we have felt it necessary to build a referenceimplementation (JUMBO) which supports as far as pos-sible all of the current elements and attributes and theirsemantics. Although JUMBO has now become a produc-tion system in much of our software, its primary raisond’etre is to show that information can be reliably pro-cessed, including round-tripping, and to provide refer-ence examples of how various constructs should beused. JUMBO deliberately does not add large numbersof chemical methods (e.g. substructure search) but con-sumes these from other OS implementations.JUMBO has been through six iterations, each more orless re-written from scratch. JUMBO1 used the ratherprimitive features in AWT1.0 to provide a hierarchicalsemantic browser of chemical documents (the namestands for Java Universal Molecular Browser forObjects). This was technically successful but not widelydeployed because of the relatively small number of CMLdocuments available at the time and the newness ofJava. JUMBO2 was a development-only version andmapped the CML elements onto editable widgets suchas textboxes, lists and molecules. It used an early ver-sion of Swing and because of the difficulties in that wasnever formally distributed.JUMBO3 returned to the browser concept and dis-played a CML document in a series of windows (rathersimilar to the current Bioclipse [44] tool). There was abrief flirtation with Java 3D for molecular display but wereverted to including Jmol [45] as a callable windowwhere required. At this stage it became clear that thecontinued development of the schema made it very diffi-cult to keep the specification and the software in sync.In JUMBO4 we attempted to use the W3C DOM imple-mentation as our data structure. This turned out to bevery problematic as the library was not designed forsubclassing and all elements had to delegate to theW3C DOM object. There were several other problemswith the W3C DOM including the lack of any XPath[46] functionality and towards the end we moved to themuch more satisfactory XOM from Elliotte Rusty Har-old [47]. This has proved to be an extremely useful andreliable choice as it not only provided a relatively simpleview on the DOM but it manages concepts such asnamespaces extremely well.As more elements were added to the schema, mainte-nance became a real problem, with 100 elements and100 attributes admissible in various combinations. Con-tent models which allowed and constrained combina-tions of child elements became very complex andunmanageable, and it was almost impossible to writeconsistent code. Therefore, in JUMBO5 we resorted toauto-generation of the basic code from the schema. Thismeant that when new elements were added the codewas regenerated from the incremented schema.JUMBO6 was primarily a refactoring of the functional-ity of JUMBO5 resulting in a clean design for the imple-mentation of converterfunctionality. We havecontinued to modularise so that now there is a basicCML XOM (where most methods simply representaccessors and mutators). JUMBO6 is a set of tools pro-viding additional chemical functionality, especially thosefor manipulating the DOM, and a separate large libraryof JUMBO-Converters which extract the output fromprograms and documents and convert it into hierarchi-cal CML docs. At this stage, we also developed Chem4-Word, which uses a fully validated convention of CML("CMLLite”). This took a much more lightweightapproach to content models and created the concept ofvalidation. In the Chem4Word system all potential inputis validated against a rich combination of XSLT expres-sions which are far more powerful than XML schema(XSD). This is now a continuing philosophy.Code-driven CML DesignAs part of the CML philosophy we have stronglyadopted the ‘rough consensus and running code’ stock(originally coined by David Clark in 1992)[48]. An excel-lent example of the value of developing code in parallelwith a specification was given in the early days of XML.The initial design included a nearly-full implementationof SGML parameter entities. At this time two or threeprototype XML parsers were being developed (NorbertMikula, Tim Bray, PMR) and it became clear that theimplementation of the full parameter entity model was amajor effort for relatively little reward, and it was there-fore dropped from the specification. We have found thesame in CML, sometimes only surfacing several yearsafter a feature was introduced. The abstraction of datainto scalars, arrays and matrices with associateddata types (XSD data types) has been a considerableeffort but its successful deployment for several years hasshown that the design is both implementable andvaluable.Similarly the design of the dictRef attribute valuehas evolved to support qualified names (QNames). Thiswas not originally driven by W3C architecture but byMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 10 of 15the need to uniquify entries in dictionaries but itbecame clear that dictRefs and other pointers/linkswere isomorphous with the URI concept (which onlybecame relatively widely-deployed about 5 years ago).The simultaneous development of code and specifica-tions meant that we could implement early versions ofQNames/URI and these are now a major feature ofCML.It is sometimes impossible to tell what the effect of aschema design will be before deployment. A particularlydifficult problem has been white space. In many cases(such as in formatted files like PDB), whitespace isextremely significant (’CA’ is calcium whereas ‘CA’ is aC-alpha). XML attributes will normalise whitespace(trimming strings and replacing all internal whitespaceby single space characters). The use of attributes and#PCDATA content have different consequences in XMLprocessors, which cannot easily be predicted beforewidespread deployment.Another major feature in the design was the need tovalidate combinations of elements and attributes. At onestage, PMR was approached by a group of pharma andrelated companies, to create a specification of CML forthe Object Management Group (OMG)[49]. Hand-cod-ing the combinations of attributes and elements provedimpossible (this is effectively a sparse 100x100 matrix)and it was clear that automated methods of validationand code-generation could be necessary. JUMBO4.6therefore generated code from the schema model ratherthan requiring it to be hand-coded. However, the W3CDOM technology was not well-suited to this, leading tothe adoption of the simpler XOM model. None of thishad an immediate effect on the surface schema of CMLbut has had deep influences on the subsequent design.As a result of this, we developed the attributes andelements largely independently; in other words, attri-butes are generally not context-specific. The commonestattributes are id, title, dictRef, and these can befound on essentially every element. Content models arenow used with optional components to generate conve-nience methods for managing child elements. Anobvious benefit is in providing auto-completion in IDEsthe CMLProperty class might prompt(e.g.for‘addArray’) (Figure 7).However, with increasing deployment to differentareas of chemistry, it became clear that it was going tobe impossible to find universal content models for mostelements. This is due to not only the diversity of chem-istry but also the different ways that chemists mightwish to organise information. A molecule might haveone or more spectra as children (representing that theseare associated analytical data). Alternatively a spectrumcould have one or more molecules as children repre-senting that these correspond to different peaks. It wasthis type of experience that led us to propose an extre-mely flexible content model, constrained by the use ofconvention rather than XSD technology.The context-free attribute design has been largely suc-cessful. In a few cases, common words such as ’type’have been used polymorphically, and have incompatibleenumerations. Thus the elements ’spectrum type =“NMR"’ and ’reaction type= “reversible"’ actu-ally use different attribute types (spectrumType andreactionType), and it was for lexical conveniencethat both of these mapped onto the string ’type’.This approach has caused considerable implementationproblems, and, were we to re-factor the schema, wewould make these unique.The use of enumerations (e.g. xsd:list) has beenbeneficial and problematic. In some cases the enumera-tion is fixed (e.g. periodic system of the elements); inothers (e.g. spectrumType) there are a number ofcommon values but we can anticipate new types as aresult of scientific discoveries and new instrumentation.The current design tried to satisfy this by giving a list ofcommon enumerated types but also adding the possibi-lity of a user-defined type (using the XSD unionapproach). This has proved extremely complex to imple-ment and has brought relatively little value. In future,we would support semi-controlled enumerationsthrough conventions rather than through XSDtechnology.Figure 7 The auto-complete functionality in IDEs is underpinned by the content model approach.Murray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 11 of 15There is a special case with XSD data types. If weadopted all (ca. 48) of these, then there would be a pos-sible commitment that implementers had to implementall of them. If the XML is being used in an XSD systemsuch as entry to a database this is manageable, but forthe more flexible requirement of heterogeneous CML itbecomes a major burden. Therefore we have arbitrarilyselected a small number of data types (xsd:string,double, integer, date, boolean). None of theseputs any restriction on how CML holds the informationand a double can be of arbitrarily large precision.In general, giving multiple options, even apparentlysimple choices, for values is an extreme burden onimplementers. A bond order was originally allowed tohave order = ‘1’ or order = ‘S’. Managing both ofthese simultaneously is a remarkably high burden andwe have deprecated and almost eliminated the use ofnumeric bond orders.The requirement that all physical quantities havedictRefs and units of measure has been extremelysuccessful. The only area where this is poorly defined isfor atomic co-ordinates in molecules. By default,these are in Ångstrom units and there was no provisionfor specifying other units. With the development ofmany CML systems in computational chemistry andphysics we need to be able to support nm, pm andatomic units (Bohr). There is currently no very cleanway of doing this and it requires the units attribute tobe added to molecule which is semantically illogicalbut currently just about manageable.It is also difficult to know at the start how many con-tainer elements should be used. For common elementssuch as property, parameter and molecule there are spe-cific container elements (*List, e.g. moleculeList).For others, we rely either on the implicit ordering thatXML supports or provide a generic cml:list element.The latter has proved to be extremely valuable in inter-preting the data in computational chemistry.The increasing availability of XPath-based technologyhas had a major positive effect on the possible flexibilityof the organisation of elements and attributes. Forexample, in documents as large as several megabytes, itis possible to use XPath expressions to locate, delete,change, add and move (sort) components. A typicalcomputational chemistry logfile or a crystallographicexperiment (CIF) in CML can be manipulated withgreat power and flexibility. This means that contentmodels are almost irrelevant whilst XPath-assisted con-ventions are a major tool in normalising and re-purpos-ing chemical information.ValidationThe original purpose of SGML was to act as a machine-enforceable contract between an author and a typesetter.SGML tools could indicate that a document was valid orinvalid and each party would know whether it was theirresponsibility or that of the other. The DTD thereforealso acted as a specification against which compliantsoftware could be written (Figure 8). This idea is verymuch at the heart of CML and represents the firstmajor infrastructure for validating chemistry (crystallo-graphy excepted).Many of the problems of software and data in chemis-try can be traced to the lack of a validation system.Without validation, the author of a program cannoteasily write conformant software if the input is variable;similarly the author cannot know whether an input is fitfor purpose. Unfortunately the past 30 years have seen awide variety of formats each with a wide variation inconformance. For example, there is no accepted ‘stan-dard’ for PDB files and many program authors havemodified this format for purposes other than managingprotein crystal structures (e.g. computational chemistryoutput). As a result, many programs corrupt informa-tion because they cannot validate the input, and theymake unwarranted assumptions. By ensuring that inputand output are both valid or validatable, it becomes pos-sible to link processes and ensure no semantic corrup-tion or loss.There are many implicit assumptions about the repre-sentation of chemistry that cause semantic problems.For example, very few datafiles state the units of mea-sure of scientific quantities and there are frequentassumptions about the existence of hydrogen atoms.There is much confusion between 2D and 3D coordi-nates and few systems can hold both at the same time.A major purpose of CML is to make sure that all che-mical information is validatable and that the rules forthis validation are openly visible. Most recently we haveconstructed Chem4Word and the CMLLite specification[50] which shows that complete validation of input andoutput chemistry is possible even in complex systems.In that case, the validation is carried out by stylesheets/XPath which has most of the power that is required.Community-driven CML DesignCML has always been a community project in that itsprogress has been visible and it has been possible foranyone to provide feedback. It is not however a com-munity-managed project and is best described by theBDFL model [51] (’Benevolent Dictator For Life’; cf.Linux). We feel this is necessary to ensure a consistentvision for the infrastructure and we have also felt thatuntil this achieved stability it was unreasonable toexpect others to volunteer contributions when theymight be discarded at any stage. There have now beenseveral sub-projects in CML where the community hasincludingbeeninvolvedactivelydesign,inMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 12 of 15Figure 8 A version of the CML DTD (in SGML) from ca. 1996. Note the early development of a namespace philosophy although there wasno technology to support it at the time. (Note: Image is a scan of an original overhead transparency with handwritten annotation).“CMLSpect” and some aspects of“CMLReact”,“CMLComp” ("compchem”). There have been very fewmajor additions to CML in the last three years despiteits increasing deployment and we therefore feel thatthe central architecture is fit for purpose and can beextended by the community in a variety of ways thatsuit their own needs (mainly through dictionaries andconventions).Foreseeable evolution of CMLOur explorations in a wide range of chemical docu-ments and documents containing chemistry have shownthat CML is capable of managing disciplines as far-ran-ging as atmospherics, minerals, enzymes, analytical andcomputational chemistry. The immediate vision is thatthe world would benefit enormously from having thismaterial available in CML. The barriers are almost allMurray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 13 of 15cultural; few chemists see the merit of this and thereforefew if any publishers of chemistry make any provisionfor doing this. We believe that the increasing value ofsemantic material (e.g. Linked Open Data, LOD) willgradually show the community that this is enormouslyimportant.There are four main methods of creating semanticchemistry: a) human authoring (as in conventional arti-cles, reports, laboratory notebooks etc.), b) conversionof chemical data from legacy formats, c) creation ofsemantic chemistry through computer program outputand d) machine extraction of chemistry from unstruc-tured and semi-structured material (e.g. electronicchemistry publications). We see the following opportu-nities and barriers to each of these, listed below. Thereis a “chicken and egg” aspect to this. We are frequentlytold that there is “no demand for CML” and as a resultpeople do not create tools that read or produce it. Inseveral cases we have attempted to overcome this bycreating believable prototypes in these areas.a) Human authoring is likely to happen when thereis a sufficient range of semantic editors. We havecreated Chem4Word to show that this is possiblebut it needs an acceptance by the community thatsemantic authoring is something that is desirable inan editor. Although the default authoring tools arecurrently Word and LaTeX, we expect that web-based tools such as GoogleDocs and EtherPad willlead to much more attractive environments in whichscientists will create documents. Two good examplesof this are Southampton’s Blog3 software [52], wherea blogging platform is used to create chemical docu-ments, and Peter Sefton’s Scholarly HTML initiative[53], showing that modern scholarship, includingscience, should be managed through HTML and notdoc/pdf.b) File format conversion. The problem of convert-ing between different file formats has been largelysolved by the Blue Obelisk community [54]. Ourown JUMBO-Converters will convert many of thecommon formats (mol, smi, pdb, cif, cdx etc.), espe-cially the more complex ones, into structured CMLwithout semantic loss. There is no technical barrierto rapid and widespread uptake by the chemicalcommunity.c) Conversion of legacy to include semantic con-tent. Many programs such as quantum chemistryand molecular dynamics produce logfiles originallyaimed at printing on fan-folded line printer paper.We have shown that it is possible to intercept alloutput statements and convert them to CML (e.g.for SIESTA, CASTEP, MOPAC, DL_POLY). Theseoutputs have been used in the computationalminerals and materials communities and we havecreated libraries (e.g. FoX [55]) to make this processeasy. However, at present most codes have notadopted this and we have therefore written a seriesof converters based on a declarative parsing technol-ogy (JUMBO-Parser) which allows for very high(greater than 95%) precision and recall of the struc-ture and semantics of the documents. These arebeing developed by the Quixote community [56] forcomputational chemistry programs and are generallyadaptable to any program which produces combinedtext and numeric output.d) Machine-extraction of chemistry. Our OSCARprogram [57] has high success (80-90% precisionand recall) in extracting chemical entities fromunstructured text. The success rate depends on thespecific domain but ranges from atmospheric chem-istry through biomedical to synthetic chemistry. Inall text-mining areas, it is much more difficult toextract processes, relationships and sentiment fromsyntheses aredocuments. However, chemicalreported in such a formulaic manner that we canextract a very high degree of the underlying seman-tics of the chemical reactions. The primary barrierto this are the legal prohibitions demanded by main-stream chemical publishers which are generallyagreed by subscribing institutions, meaning that it isa contractual violation to undertake text-miningactivities. BMC journals are an exception (beingpublished as CC-BY) but there is relatively littlemainstream chemistry published in BMC at themoment. We have been able to show that we canextract chemistry from patents, although the qualityof many of these is not perfect and there are errorsdue to transcription. Recently the British Library hasargued strongly for the reform of intellectual prop-erty laws to allow text-mining for scientific andrelated purposes [58], and if this were to happen,there are enormous opportunities for CML technol-ogy to provide near-universal semantic chemistry.Assuming that the cultural, political and legal barriersare removed, it is very cost-effective to produce all che-mical information using CML. We have shown that, atnear-zero cost, the whole of published crystallographicdata can be converted into semantic form (250, 000structures in CrystalEye). Similarly, we have read 100,000 patents and extracted reactions; others have usedOSCAR to add semantics to information from Medline.If the chemical community can agree identifier systemsfor the components (molecules, reactions, spectra etc.),this would create a huge resource of chemistry to beadded to the LOD cloud. We would expect this to beindexed on compounds, substances, reactions, spectra,Murray-Rust and Rzepa Journal of Cheminformatics 2011, 3:44http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/44Page 14 of 15crystal structures and many aspects of physical chemis-try. By creating dictionaries, ideally with the involvementof authorities such as IUPAC and IUCr, we then have acomprehensive semantic framework with a simple com-putable ontology. It is difficult to predict exactly whatthe benefits of this will be, but they will be massive.LOD provides for linking between disciplines, e.g. theconcentration of chemicals in the atmosphere at differ-ent times and geographical locations. It allows for sys-tematics within a sub-discipline (e.g. comparing allpublished synthetic procedures and analysing these forthe potential value of reaction conditions, catalysts etc.)It allows experimental data (e.g. crystal structure) to beused to calibrate computational approaches such asquantum mechanics. With the addition of natural lan-guage, this becomes a human-accessible resource wherewe can ask simple powerful questions to the machinesuch as “find me all spectra which contain NMR shiftsbelow zero and which do not contain metals” or “findme all solvents involved in reactions above their boilingpoint”. In computational chemistry, CML can largelyautomate the process of creating multiple jobs throughparameters sweeps and analysing and searching the out-puts. Indeed, it is reasonable to see program manualsbeing replaced by CML dictionaries appropriate to thatprogram, and understandable both by machines andhumans.SustainabilityEvery semantic project must address its sustainability. Inthe past CML has been highly dependent on its twoauthors. The technical resource to support it in its cur-rent form is now relatively modest, so that in principleit could be forked or continued (the “Dr. Who model ofOS”[59]) were the current authors to become inactive. Ithas been implicitly and explicitly endorsed by a range ofcompanies and organisations including the IUCr, Unile-ver Research, Microsoft Research and the National Can-cer Institute of the US National Institutes for Health.There is a wide range of CML-compliant software and alarge number of examples. Its technical sustainabilitytherefore seems assured, and its political sustainability isbeyond the scope of this article. We are confident thatin the not too distant future publishers such as BMCwill enthusiastically accept contributions consistingpartly or mainly of CML.EndnotesEndnote 1CML is a joint creation of the two authors over manyyears.
