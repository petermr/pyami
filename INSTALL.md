# preamble
Since there are other packages called `pyami` (nothing to do with us) the formal name in `PyPI` will be `py4ami`. Informally we may use `pyami`.

There are two sections here: for those who want to download and use `py4ami` and those who are developing and uploading.


# Installation for users (download)
`py4ami` is now a `PyPI` project and by default will be installed from there. `py4ami` is now versioned as `d.d.d` (major/minor/patch). Generally you should install the latest version unless indicated.

## location
See https://pypi.org/project/py4ami/

# ====================================
# installation for developers (upload)
# ====================================

## quick instructions for experienced users
```
cd pyami
rm -rf dist
# EDIT VERSION NUMBER IN setup.py (or it clashes)
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/* # <login is pypi, not github>
pip uninstall py4ami
pip install py4ami
YES WE HAVE TO DO THIS TWICE TO FLUSH OUT THE OLD VERSION
pip uninstall py4a
pip install py4ami
```

## for new developers =============

**Follow this carefully. Make sure you are uploading the latest version**

````
cd <pyami> # wherever `pyami` is located
````
This should contain files like:
````
ls -l
total 88

## edit the version in `setup.py`

**Every upload should have a new increased version, even if the edits are minor.**

Find the version number in `setup.py` and increase it:
````
    name='py4ami',
    url='https://github.com/petermr/pyami',
    version='0.0.6',    # increased from `0.0.5`
    description='Semantic Reader of the Scientific Literature.',
    long_description="""Pyami converts scientific articles to structured form (discrete files for sections, subsections, etc.).

````
## remove old `dist/`
````
 rm -r dist
```` 
If you don't do this it will upload the previous dist and probably throw errors. 


## create MANIFEST.in

Check MANIFEST.in.
Note that `graft` includes the full subtree. We include the test data which makes the distrib about 20 Mb.
````
more MANIFEST.in 
include LICENSE
graft py4ami/resources
include config.ini.master
include py4ami/pyami.ini
include CONFIG.md
````

## create distribution (`dist`)
````
python setup.py sdist
````
This outputs the following 
````
running sdist
running egg_info
writing py4ami.egg-info/PKG-INFO
writing dependency_links to py4ami.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
writing entry points to py4ami.egg-info/entry_points.txt
