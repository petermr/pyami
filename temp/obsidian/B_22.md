Climate-related policies have also contributed to decreasing GHG emissions.
=======lesser claims==========
 Policies such as taxes and subsidies for clean and public transportation, and renewable policies have reduced GHG emissions in some contexts (robust evidence, high agreement). Pollution control policies and legislations that go beyond end-of-pipe controls have also had climate co-benefits, particularly if complementarities with GHG emissions are considered in policy design (medium evidence, medium agreement). Policies on agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and AFOLU sector-related policies such as afforestation policies can have important impacts on GHG emissions (medium evidence, medium agreement). {2.8.4}
