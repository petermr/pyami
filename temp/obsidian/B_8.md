(high confidence). In developed countries, consumption-based CO2 emissions peaked at 15 GtCO2 in 2007, declining to about 13 GtCO2 in 2018. The Asia and Developing Pacific region, with 52% of current global population, has become a major contributor to consumption-based CO2 emission growth since 2000 (5.5% yr-1 for 2000-2018); it exceeded the developed countries region, which accounts for 16% of current global population, as the largest emitter of consumption-based CO2. {2.3.2, Figure 2.14}
