(high confidence)Assuming variations in historic patterns of use and decommissioning, estimated future CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone are 660 (460-890) GtCO2 and from existing and currently planned infrastructure 850 (600-1100) GtCO2. This compares to overall cumulative net CO2 emissions until reaching net zero CO2 of 510 (330-710) Gt in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and 880 (640-1160) Gt in pathways that limit likely warming to 2°C (high confidence). While most future CO2 emissions from existing and currently planned fossil fuel infrastructure are situated in the power sector, most remaining fossil fuel CO2 emissions in pathways that limit likely warming to 2°C and below are from non-electric energy – most importantly from the industry and transportation sectors (high confidence). Decommissioning and reduced utilization of existing fossil fuel installations in the power sector as well as cancellation of new installations are required to align future CO2 emissions from the power sector with projections in these pathways (high confidence). {2.7.2, 2.7.3, Figure 2.26, Table 2.6, Table 2.7}
