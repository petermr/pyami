(high confidence).
  Since 2010, GHG emissions have continued to grow reaching 59±6.6 GtCO2eq in 20191,
  but the average annual growth in the last decade (1.3%, 2010-2019) was lower than in the previous decade
  (2.1%, 2000-2009) (high confidence). Average annual GHG emissions were 56 GtCO2eqyr-1
  for the decade 2010-2019 growing by about 9.1 GtCO2eqyr-1 from the previous decade (2000-2009) – the highest decadal average on record (high confidence). {2.2.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.5}
