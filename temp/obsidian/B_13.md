Average annual growth in GHG emissions from energy supply decreased from 2.3% for 2000–2009 to 1.0% for 2010–2019

(high confidence). This slowing of growth is attributable to further improvements in energy efficiency (annually, 1.9% less energy per unit of GDP was used globally between 2010 and 2019). Reductions in global carbon intensity by -0.2% yr-1 contributed further - reversing the trend during 2000-2009 (+0.2% yr-1) (medium confidence). These carbon intensity improvement were driven by fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity particularly in Eastern Asia, and the increased use of renewables. {2.2.4, 2.4.2.1, Figure 2.17}
