While previous WGIII assessments have discussed mitigation pathways, focus on development pathways is more recent.

The  &#8220;emissions gap&#8221;  is  understood  as  the  difference  between  the  emissions  with  NDCs  in  2030,  and  mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goals. In general, the term &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; refers to the difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected outcome  of  existing  policies.

Yet  perceived  or  real  conflicts  between  mitigation  and  other  Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1038">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1039">).

For example, policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived  and  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  overall  societal  development  objectives,  such  as  job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, such  policies  are  framed  as  part  of  a  just  transition.  However,  they  can  have  major  influence  on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway &#8220;Shifting Pathways&#8221; (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1074">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1075">).

These examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies  and  societies.  Coordinated  policy  mixes  would  need  to  coordinate  multiple  actors&#8212;individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors&#8212;to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. {4.3,  4.3.1,  4.3.2,  4.4.2,  4.4.3,  4.4.1.7-4.4.1.10,  Figure  4.7,  Cross-Chapter  Box  5,  5.8,  Box  6.2,  8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}  </span></div><div style="" id="id1215"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1216">The  literature  identifies  a  broad  set  of  enabling  conditions  that  can  both  foster  shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation, along five categories</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1218">.

Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention in  the  near-term.

Charting just transitions to net zero may provide a vision, which policy measures can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider a broader toolbox of enablers and levers that is available in domains that have not traditionally been climate policy. {4.5, Annex II Part IV Section 11} </span></div><div style="" id="id1358"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1359">Broadening opportunities</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1360"> by focusing on development pathways and considering how to shift them: Some of the policy measures may yield rapid results, whereas other, larger transformations may take longer.

In addition to this persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and sufficient international support is not yet available to developing countries who have requested and quantified support needs. Continuing along a development pathway characterized by the same underlying drivers, structural obstacles and insufficient  enabling  conditions  that  led  to  high  emissions  will  not  address  the  problem  (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1550">robust evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1552">). </span></div><div style="" id="id1554"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1555">The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (see Cross-Chapter Box 4). Chapter 3 is working backward, assessing mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to draw the near- and mid-term implications of long-term temperature and mitigations goals. Chapter 4, on the other hand, works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (4.2.1, 4.2.2) and from current development  paths  to  assess  the  implications  for  near-  and  mid-term  Greenhouse  Gases  (GHG) emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national low emission development strategies (4.2.4). </span></div><div style="" id="id1564"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1565">Where do we want to go? </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1566">Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and implementation  gaps,  and  the  literature  illustrates  these  with  a  wide  range  of  accelerated  techno-economic  pathways  that  deepen  decarbonisation  closer  to  the  pace  and  scale  required  (4.2.5),  and examines their impacts on other development objectives (4.2.6). In practice, however, scaling up at the broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet climate goals while advancing other development objectives  regularly  faces  prohibitive  obstacles  (4.2.7).

Shifting development pathways can be necessitated by the existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching mitigation and other  development  objectives  (4.2.7).  Deliberate  measures  taken  to  facilitate  the  shifting  of development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that help  overcome  those  obstacles  (see  Figure  4.6)&#8212;improving  governance  and  institutional  capacity, fostering  behavioural  change  and  technological  innovation,  designing  and  implementing  adequate policy, and finance.

The  national  scale  selected in  this  Chapter  requires  attention  as  national mitigation  pathways cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (see Box 4.2). This chapter is also concerned mostly with economy-wide development and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that is assessed in the systems chapters 6 to 12. The present chapter also assesses literature on non-state action. </span></div><div style="" id="id1750"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1751">Chapter  4  draws  on  five  major  strands  of  literature:  (1)  an  emerging  literature  on  development pathways&#8212;conceptual, empirical, and model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; (2)  a  rapidly  expanding,  model-based,  literature  on  mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  and  mid-term (Lepault and Lecocq 2021); (3) studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (4) a broader literature on transformation and shifts in development pathways, including from non-climate literatures; and (5) a significant literature on equity, including just transitions.

In AR5, all mitigation pathways were assessed in a single chapter  (Clarke  et  al.  2014),  which  focused  mostly  on  the  long-term.  SR1.5  included  a  chapter  on mitigation pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a), mostly at the global level. It also considered strengthening mitigation (de Coninck et al. 2018) in the context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (Roy et al. 2018). Development pathways have also been explored, albeit less frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on Emissions  Scenarios  (Nakicenovic  et  al.  2000).  Some  early  framing  of  development  pathways  was included in the Third Assessment Report (William R. Moomaw et al. 2001), further developed in the Fourth Assessment Report (Sathaye et al. 2007).

Section  4.2.6  discusses  certain  distributional implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note the  relevance  of  potential  distributional  impacts  as  an  obstacle  to  climate  action,  as  well  as  the inequitable  distribution  of  decision-making  authority.  Finally,  section  4.5  recognizes  the  structural relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as an international focal point tying together  social  movements,  trade  unions,  and  other  stakeholders,  and  thus  an  instrumental  role  in establishing consensus. </span></div><div style="" id="id1869"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id1870">4.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id1872">Accelerating mitigation actions across scales  </span></div><div style="" id="id1874"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1875">4.2.1</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id1877">Mitigation targets and measures in nationally determined contributions </span></div><div style="" id="id1879"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1880">A central instrument of the Paris Agreement is the NDCs, submitted by each country, and reflecting national efforts to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change.

In  all  cases,  the  reductions  are  then  estimated  on  top  of  the  resulting  emission trajectory.  Note  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  may  vary  the  approach  used  depending  on  the country. </span></div><div style="" id="id2497"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2498">Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs. independent  inventory  data)  and  related  accounting  approaches  used  as  a  starting  point  for  the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.),  and  (v)  the  degree  to  which  individual  policies  and  their  impact  on  emissions  are  explicitly represented (Table 4.1). </span></div><div style="" id="id2506"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2507">First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to national level (4.2.2.3) and subnational and company level in a few cases (4.2.3).  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  typically  resolve  a  limited number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but  have  poor  resolution  of  remaining  countries  or  regions,  which  are  assessed  in  aggregate  terms. Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture from  detailed  national  studies  (Bataille  et  al.  2016a;  Deep  Decarbonization  Pathways  Project  2015; Roelfsema et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id2517"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2518">A second dimension in which the studies are different is their comprehensiveness of covering different emitting sectors. Some studies focus on the contribution of a single sector, for example the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector (Fyson and Jeffery 2019; Grassi et al. 2017) or the energy system (including both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as specified in the NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance of a given sector to achieving the NDC target of a country and can be used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding sectoral contributions up represents a methodological challenge. </span></div><div style="" id="id2526"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2527">Third,  GHG  coverage  is  different  across  studies.

Detailed representations (such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different. </span></div><div style="" id="id2703"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2704">Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at subnational level.

The evidence base for the updated NDC assessment is thus considerably smaller compared to that of the assessment of emissions implications of original NDCs presented in Section 4.2.2.3. However, it is worthwhile to note that the earlier versions of the studies summarized in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 are broadly  representative  for  the  emissions  range  implied  by  the  pre-COVID-19  current  policies  and original NDCs of the full set of studies shown in Table 4.1, therefore building confidence in estimates. </span></div><div style="" id="id6655"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id6656">An additional challenge lies in the fact that these studies do not all apply the same cut-off date for NDC updates, potentially leading to larger systematic deviations in the resulting emission estimates. Another complication is the fact that publicly announced mitigation pledges on global 2030 emissions that have not been officially submitted to the UNFCCC NDC registry yet, have been included in several of the studies to anticipate their impact on emission levels (see notes to Table 4.3). In addition to the updates of NDC targets, most of the new studies also include impacts of COVID-19 on future emission levels (as discussed in 4.2.2.4) which may have led to considerable downward revisions of emission trends unrelated to NDCs.

Further, several Parties provided information on specific criteria for evaluating fairness and ambition, including criteria relating to: responsibility and capability; share of emissions; development and/or technological capacity; mitigation potential; cost of mitigation actions; the degree of progression or stretching beyond the current level of effort; and the link to objectives and global goals (UNFCCC 2016a). </span></div><div style="" id="id7474"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7475">According to its Article 2.2, the Paris Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities,  in  the  light  of  different national circumstances, the latter clause being new, added to the UNFCCC principle (Rajamani 2017; Voigt  and  Ferreira  2016).  Possible  different  interpretations  of  equity  principles  lead  to  different assessment frameworks (Lahn 2018; Lahn and Sundqvist 2017). </span></div><div style="" id="id7481"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7482">Various  assessment  frameworks  have  been  proposed  to  analyse  fair  share  ranges  for  NDCs.  The literature on equity frameworks including quantification of national emissions allocation is assessed in section 4.5 (see 13.4.2, 14.3.2 and 14.5.3). Recent literature has assessed equity, analysing how fairness is expressed in NDCs in a bottom-up manner (Cunliffe et al. 2019; Mbeva and Pauw 2016; Winkler et al. 2018). Some studies compare NDC ambition level with different effort sharing regimes and which principles are applied to various countries and regions (Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen 2018; Robiou Du Pont et al. 2017; Holz et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017; van den Berg et al. 2019). Others propose multi-dimensional evaluation schemes for NDCs that combine a range of indicators, including  the  NDC  targets,  cost-effectiveness  compared  to  global  models,  recent  trends  and  policy implementation into consideration (Aldy et al. 2017; H&#246;hne et al. 2018). Yet other literature evaluates NDC  ambition  against  factors  such  as  technological  progress  of  energy  efficiency  and  low-carbon technologies (Jiang et al. 2017; Wakiyama and Kuramochi 2017; Kuramochi et al.  2017), synergies with adaptation plans (Fridahl and Johansson 2017), the obligations to deploy carbon dioxide removal technologies like BECCS in the future implied by their near-term emission reductions where they are not reflected on in the first NDCs (Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Peters and Geden 2017; Mace et al.  2021).  Others  identify  possible  risks  of  unfairness  when  applying  GWP*  as  emissions  metric  at national scale (Rogelj and Schleussner 2019). A recent study on national fair shares draws on principles of  international  environmental  law,  excludes  approaches  based  on  cost  and  grandfathering,  thus narrowing the range of national fair shares previously assessed, and apply this to the quantification of national fair share emissions targets (Rajamani et al. 2021).  </span></div><div style="" id="id7503"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7504">4.2.2.8</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7506">Uncertainty in estimates </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id7508">There are many factors that influence the global aggregated effects of NDCs.

By 2030 the adaptation needs are expected to be 3 to 6 times larger than what is pledged, further increasing towards 2050 (UNEP 2016; New et al. 2020). </span></div><div style="" id="id8213"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id8214">END BOX 4.1 HERE </span></div><div style="" id="id8216"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id8217">4.2.3</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id8219">Mitigation efforts in subnational and non-state action plans and policies </span></div><div style="" id="id8221"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8222">The decision adopting the Paris Agreement stresses the importance of  &#8220;stronger and more ambitious climate action&#8221; by non-government and subnational stakeholders, &#8220;including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples&#8221;  (UNFCCC  2015e).  The  Marrakech  Partnership  for  Global  Action,  launched  in  the  2016 UNFCCC Conference of Parties by two &#8220;high-level champions,&#8221; further formalized the contributions of  non-government  and subnational  actors taking  action  through  seven thematic  areas  (e.g.,  energy, human settlements, industry, land-use, etc.) and one cross-cutting area (resilience). Since then,  non-state  actors,  e.g.,  companies  and  civil  society,  and  subnational  actors,  e.g.  cities  and  regions,  have emerged to undertake a range of largely voluntary carbon mitigation actions (Hsu et al. 2019, 2018) both  as  individual  non-state  actors  (NSA  in  the  following)  and  through  national  and  international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) (Hsu et al. 2018). ICIs take a variety of forms, ranging from those that focus solely on non-state actors to those that engage national and even local governments. They can also  range  in  commitment  level,  from  primarily  membership-based  initiatives  that  do  not  require specific actions to those that require members to tackle emissions reductions in specific sectors or aim for transformational change. </span></div><div style="" id="id8250"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8251">Non  state  action  could  make  significant  contributions  to  achieving  the  Paris  climate  goals  (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8252">limited evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8254">). However, efforts to measure the extent to which non-state and subnational actors go beyond national policy are still nascent (Kuramochi et al. 2020; Hsu et al. 2019) and we do not  fully  understand  the  extent  to  which  ambitious  action  by  non-state  actors  is  additional  to  what national governments intend to do. Subnational and non-state climate action may also have benefits in reinforcing, implementing, or piloting national policy, in place of or in addition to achieving additional emissions reductions (Broekhoff et al. 2015; Heidrich et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2017). </span></div><div style="" id="id8261"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id8262">Quantification of commitments by individual NSAs are limited to date.

The table shows wide ranges of potential mitigation based on current, target or potential membership, as well as a wide diversity of actors and membership assumptions. Current membership reflects the number of non-state or subnational actors that are presently committed to a particular initiative; while targeted or potential membership represents a membership goal (e.g., increasing from 100 to 200 members) that an initiative may seek to achieve (Kuramochi et al. 2020).

As Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to significantly contribute  to  global  mitigation  efforts.  For  example,  the  SBTi  (Science-Based  Targets  Initiative) encourages companies to pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTI would be compatible  with  global  pathways  to  well  below  2&#176;C  or  1.5&#176;C,  with  various  methodologies  being proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; Faria and Labutong 2019). Readers may note, however, that the link between emissions by individual actors and long-term temperature goals cannot be inferred without additional assumptions (see Box 4.2). In the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging to  stop  methane  emissions  associated  with  oil  and  gas  supply  chains.  The  Oil  and  Gas  Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has recently  published  a  comprehensive  framework  for  methane  detection,  measurement  and  reporting (UNEP 2020b). </span></div><div style="" id="id10184"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10185">Initiatives focused on non-CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id10186">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10187"> emissions, and particularly on methane, can achieve sizable reductions, in the order of multiple GtCO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id10189">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10190">-eq yr</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id10191">-1</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id10192"> (see Table 4.4). The Global Cement and Concrete Association (formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has contributed to the development of consistent energy and  emissions  reporting  from  member  companies.

Bhutan  and  Suriname  already  have  achieved  net  negative emissions.  France  second &#8220;low-carbon  national strategy&#8221;  adopted in 2020 has  an  objective  of  GHG neutrality by 2050. Net zero is also the basis of the recent revision of the official notional price of carbon for public investment in France  (Quinet et al. 2019). The Committee on Climate Change of the UK analyses sectoral options and concludes that delivering net zero GHG by 2050 is technically feasible but  highly  challenging  (Committee  on  Climate  Change  2019).  For  Germany,  three  steps  to  climate neutrality by 2050 are introduced: First, a 65% reduction of emissions by 2030; second, a complete switch to climate- neutral technologies, leading to a 95% cut in emissions, all relative to 1990 levels by 2050; and third balancing of residual emissions through carbon capture and storage (G&#246;rz et al. 2020).

In the case of Japan, the new target to net zero GHG emission by 2050 was announced in 2020 (UN 2020c).

For  example,  the  Enquete Commission in  Germany  identified  robust  and  sustainable  80%  emission reduction pathways (Deutscher Bundestag 2002).

In South Africa, improving industry and building energy efficiency is also considered a key part of mitigation strategies (Ouedraogo 2017; Altieri et al. 2016). </span></div><div style="" id="id13503"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13504">Table 4.8 Targets by countries, regions, cities and businesses on decarbonising the building sector </span></div><div style="" id="id13506"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13507">Countries </span></div><div style="" id="id13509"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13510">Subnational Regions </span></div><div style="" id="id13513"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13514">Cities </span></div><div style="" id="id13516"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13517">Businesses </span></div><div style="" id="id13519"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13520">Shift to 100 per cent (near-) zero energy buildings for new buildings </span></div><div style="" id="id13523"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13524">Fully decarbonise the building sector </span></div><div style="" id="id13526"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13527">Phase out fossil fuels (for example, gas) for residential heating </span></div><div style="" id="id13530"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13531">Increase the rate of zero-energy renovations </span></div><div style="" id="id13533"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13534">3 </span></div><div style="" id="id13536"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13537">1 </span></div><div style="" id="id13539"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13540">1 </span></div><div style="" id="id13542"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13543">1 (public buildings) </span></div><div style="" id="id13546"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13547">6 </span></div><div style="" id="id13549"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13550">6 </span></div><div style="" id="id13552"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13553">- </span></div><div style="" id="id13555"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13556">&gt;28 </span></div><div style="" id="id13558"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13559">&gt;28 </span></div><div style="" id="id13561"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13562">&gt;3 </span></div><div style="" id="id13564"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13565">&gt;44 </span></div><div style="" id="id13567"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13568">&gt;44 </span></div><div style="" id="id13573"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id13574">Source: (H&#246;hne et al. 2020) (supplementary information).

First,  the  carbon constraint  imposes  reduced  use  of  a  production  factor  (fossil  energy),  thus  reducing  GDP.  In  the simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (Fujimori et al.  2019),  except  in  Keynesian  models  in  which  increased  public  investment  actually  boosts  GDP (Pollitt et al. 2015; Bulavskaya and Reyn&#232;s 2018; Landa Rivera et al. 2016). Magnitude and duration of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-GHG-intensive  goods  and  services,  assumptions  about  costs  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  their evolution over time (e.g., (Duan et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; Fragkos et al. 2017) (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14674">high evidence</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14675">, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14676">high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14677">). </span></div><div style="" id="id14679"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id14680">In the near-term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital stock, and rigidities in the labour market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-term,  on  the  other  hand,  physical  and  human  capital,  technology,  institutions,  skills  or  location  of households and  activities  are  more flexible.  The  development  of renewable  energy  may help  create more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Hartley et al. 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP. </span></div><div style="" id="id14720"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14721">(Blazquez et al. 2017) </span></div><div style="" id="id14723"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14724">Saudi Arabia </span></div><div style="" id="id14726"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14727">(Wei et al. 2019) </span></div><div style="" id="id14729"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14730">China </span></div><div style="" id="id14732"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14733">(Gupta et al. 2019) </span></div><div style="" id="id14735"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14736">India </span></div><div style="" id="id14738"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14739">(Huang et al. 2019) </span></div><div style="" id="id14741"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14742">China </span></div><div style="" id="id14754"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14755">Renewable  energy  penetration  assumed  to  free  oil  that would  have  been  sold  at  publicly  subsidised  price  on  the </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14758">domestic market to be sold internationally at market price </span></div><div style="" id="id14760"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id14761">Analyse  impacts  of  feed-in  tariffs  to  renewables,  find positive short-run impacts on GDP; public spending boost activity in the RE sector.

Chateau et al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly as  policies  that  internalise  environmental  externalities  through  taxes  and  other  tools,  shifting </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15092">profitability from polluting to green sectors) need not harm total employment, and that the broad skill </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15094">composition (low-, high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors is very similar, with the largest shares of job creation and destruction at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour market  transition,  they  conclude  that  it  may  be  important  to  reduce  labour  taxes,  to  compensate vulnerable households, and to provide education and training programs, the latter making it easier for labour to move to new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) find  relatively  small  (positive  or  negative)  impacts  on  aggregate  global  employment  that  are  more positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today are  heavily  dependent  on  fossil  fuels  (Arndt  et  al.  2013;  Huang  et  al.  2019;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016; Jacobson et al. 2019).  Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they are  more  likely  to  have  to  reallocate,  something  that  can  come  at  a  cost  in  the  form  of  a  wage  cut (assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in labour  taxes  often  leads  to  the  most  positive  employment  outcomes  while  lump-sum  (uniform  per-capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome. </span></div><div style="" id="id15110"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15111">The  results  from  country-level  studies  using  CGE  models  tend  be  similar  to  those  at  global  level.

Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect low-skilled  workers  (see  previous  section).  Distributional  issues  have  been  identified  not  only  with explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 2019; Bruegge et al. 2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id15281"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15282">Distributional implications, however, are context specific, depending on consumption patterns (initially and ease of adjusting them in response to price changes) and asset ownership (see for example analysis of energy prices in Indonesia by Renner et al.

(2019)  find  that,  in  countries  with  a  per-capita  income  of  up  to  USD15,000  per  capita  (PPP adjusted), carbon  pricing  has  a  progressive impact  on  income  distribution and that there may  be  an inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering carbon  pricing  regressive  in  high-income  countries,  i.e.,  in  countries  where  the  capacity  to  pursue compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong. </span></div><div style="" id="id15311"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15312">Distributional  concerns  related  to  climate  mitigation  are  also  prevalent  in  developed  countries,  as demonstrated, for instance, by France&#8217;s recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different incomes  levels  but  also  horizontal  redistribution  (i.e.,  redistribution  between  households  at  similar incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15319">Compared  to  vertical  redistribution,  it  is  more  difficult  to  devise  policies  that  effectively  address horizontal redistribution (Douenne 2020; Cronin et al. 2019; Pizer and Sexton 2019).

Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a different angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne and Fabre 2020). (See section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public support for carbon taxation.). </span></div><div style="" id="id15453"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id15454">4.2.7</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id15456">Obstacles to accelerated mitigation and how overcoming them amounts to shifts </span></div><div style="" id="id15458"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 12px;" id="id15459">in development pathways  </span></div><div style="" id="id15461"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15462">As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved understanding since AR5 of what accelerated  mitigation  would  entail  in  the  coming  decades.

In other words, while the implementation of mitigation policies to achieve updated NDC  almost  doubles  the  mitigation  efforts,  and  notwithstanding  the  widespread  availability  of  the necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows the gap to pathways consistent with 2&#176;C by at most 20%.  </span></div><div style="" id="id15490"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15491">Table 4.10 Objections to accelerated mitigation and where they are assessed in the WG3 report </span></div><div style="" id="id15493"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15494">Category  </span></div><div style="" id="id15496"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15497">Main dimensions </span></div><div style="" id="id15499"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15500">Costs of mitigation </span></div><div style="" id="id15502"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15503">Marginal,  sectoral  or  macroeconomic  costs  of </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15505">mitigation too high; Scarce resources could/should be used  for  other  development  priorities;  Mitigation </span></div><div style="" id="id15508"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15509">Location  in  WGIII  report where objection is assessed and solutions are discussed </span></div><div style="" id="id15513"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 9px;" id="id15514">3.6, 4.2.6, 12.2, Chapter 15, </span></div><div style="" id="id15518"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15519">Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute </span></div><div style="" id="id15521"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15522">4-58  </span></div><div style="" id="id15524"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15525">Total pages: 156</span></div><div style="" id="id15561"/>

As  discussed  in  4.2.6.3,  the  distributional implications of climate policies depend strongly on their design, the way they are implemented, and on the context into which they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have both ethics and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/acceptable by a given society in a given context, notably the relative power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken into account, or not, in the relevant decision-making processes. Like costs, distributional implications of accelerated mitigation are rooted in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society. </span></div><div style="" id="id15676"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15677">The  last  set  of  obstacles  revolves  around  the  unsuitability  of  existing  structures  to  accelerated mitigation. We include here all forms of established structures, material (e.g., physical capital) or not (institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), that are potentially long-lived and limit the  implementation  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways.  Typically,  such  structures  exist  for  reasons other than climate change and climate mitigation, including the distribution of power among various actors. Modifying them in the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with other non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15685">to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private property in buildings. </span></div><div style="" id="id15721"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15722">Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute </span></div><div style="" id="id15724"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15725">4-59  </span></div><div style="" id="id15727"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15728">Total pages: 156</span></div><div style="" id="id15786"/><div style="" id="id15832"/>

As  a  result,  transforming  those underlying  structures  can  help  to  remove  those  obstacles,  and  thus  facilitate  the  acceleration  of mitigation.  This  remark  is  all  the  more  important  that  accelerated  mitigation  pathways,  while  very different across countries, all share three characteristics: speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction achieving more ambitious targets. Transforming those underlying structures amounts to shifting a society&#8217;s development pathway (Figure </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15857">4.6). In the following Sections 3 and 4, we argue that it is thus necessary to recast accelerated mitigation in  the  broader  context  of  shifting  development  pathways,  and  that  doing  so  opens  up  additional opportunities to (i) overcome the obstacles outlined above, and also (ii) combine climate mitigation with other development objectives. </span></div><div style="" id="id15891"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15892">Do Not Cite, Quote or Distribute </span></div><div style="" id="id15894"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15895">4-60  </span></div><div style="" id="id15897"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15898">Total pages: 156</span></div><div style="" id="id15902"/><div style="" id="id15953"/>

A society&#8217;s development pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of possible  features,  trends,  processes,  and  mechanisms.  It  can  be  examined  in  terms  of  specific quantitative  indicators,  such  as  population,  urbanisation  level,  life  expectancy,  literacy  rate,  GDP, carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with reference  to  trends  and  shifts  in  broad  socio-political  or  cultural  features,  such  as  democratisation, liberalisation,  colonisation,  globalisation,  consumerism,  etc.  Or,  it  can  be  described  in  a  way  that highlights  and  details  a  particular  domain  of  interest;  for  example,  as  an  &#8220;economic  pathway&#8221;, &#8220;technological  pathway&#8221;,  &#8220;demographic  pathway&#8221;,  or  others.

Addressing them calls  for  interventions  affecting  fundamental,  interconnected,  structural  features  of  global  society (International  Panel on  Social  Progress  2018;  TWI2050  -  The  World in  2050 2018),  such  as to  our physical  infrastructure  (e.g.,  energy,  water,  industrial,  urban  infrastructure)  (Thacker  et  al.  2019; Adshead et al. 2019; Waage et al. 2015; Mansell et al. 2019; Chester 2019), our societal institutions (e.g., educational, public health, economic, innovation, and political institutions)  (Sachs et al. 2019; Ostrom  2010;  Kl&#228;y  et  al.  2015;  Messner  2015),  and  behavioural  and  cultural  tendencies  (e.g., consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt to  address  each  SDG  in  isolation,  or  as  independent  technical  challenges,  would  be  insufficient,  as would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean significant  disruption  of  long-standing  trends  and  transformative  progress  to  shift  development pathways  to  meet  all  the  SDGs,  including  climate  action,  beyond  incremental  changes  targeted  at addressing  mitigation  objectives  in  isolation.  In  other  words,  mitigation  conceived  as  incremental change is not enough.

Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia (Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI, 2015), South  Africa  (Winkler  2018)  and  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (Dorband  et  al.  2019). Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to other dimensions such as in access to energy services (Tait 2017), gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), and thereby assumes relevance in both developing and developed countries. The development priorities of many poor  countries  and  communities  with  low  capacities  to  adapt,  has  been  focused  more  on  reducing poverty,  providing  basic  infrastructure,  education  and  improving  health,  rather  than  on  mitigation (Chimhowu et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id16980"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16981">A systematic assessment of 107 national development plans and 10 country case studies provides useful insights regarding the type and content of the plans (Chimhowu et al. 2019). development plans are increasingly focusing on mobilising action across multiple actors and multiple dimensions to enhance resilience and improve the ability to undertake stronger mitigation actions. Various initiatives such as the  World  Summit  for  Children  in  1990;  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Country  initiative  that  started offering debt relief in exchange for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards Comprehensive Development Frameworks seem to have catalysed the development of national actions plans across countries to estimate, measure and track investments and progress towards SDGs. </span></div><div style="" id="id16991"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16992">The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16994">Complexity  science  has  over  the  years  argued  for  new  forms  of  planning  based  on  contingency, behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), and  new  plans  have  increasingly  focused  on  increasing  resilience  of  individuals,  organisations  and systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013).

This misses the point that development drives emissions, and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of development, degree of inequality, and population growth. </span></div><div style="" id="id17378"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17379">Looking  ahead,  choices  about  the  nature  of  economic  activities  are  expected  to  have  significant implications for emissions.

In fact, factors affecting household  consumption  based  emissions  include  household  size,  age,  education  attainment, employment status, urban vs rural location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There is evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase in emissions from additional consumption of  the  lower  income  households  could  be  larger  than  the  reduction  in  emissions  from  the  drop  in consumption from the high income households (Sager 2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil the objective of reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in emissions (Sager 2019).  </span></div><div style="" id="id17565"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17566">The  Illustrative  Mitigation  Pathways  (IMP)  developed  for  this  Report  (Box  3.1  and  section  3.2.5) provide  another  example  of  how  development  pathways  influence  mitigative  capacity.

Each society whether in  the  Global  North  or  the  Global  South  follows  its  own  pattern  of  development  (Figure 1.6). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By extension, the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18485">sector or of industrial systems). </span></div><div style="" id="id18487"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18488">2.

Absent climate mitigation, our collective ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 is likely to be compromised, even if adaptation measures are put in place (WGII). </span></div><div style="" id="id18719"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18720">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3, 17.3) (Figures 3.40, 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to lower-emissions  electricity  generation technologies  and  from  Internal  Combustion  Engine  to  lower-carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local air pollution (Box 6.2, 10.4.1).

In  the city  example  of  section  2a,  a  carbon  tax alone would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon mobility  could  both  facilitate  equitable  access  to  housing  (a  major  development  objective  in  many countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway. </span></div><div style="" id="id18848"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18849">Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), driven  by  targeted  policies,  investment  and  enabling  socio-cultural  and  behavioural  change,  would reduce  pressure  on  supply  side  mitigation  need,  hence  limiting  pressure  on  water  and  food  and  the achievement of associated SDGs.

For  example,  fundamentally  different responses  to  the  first  oil  shock  shifted  then-comparable  economies  on  to  different  energy  sector development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009).

Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent needs  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities (4.3.2, 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities. </span></div><div style="" id="id19226"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19227">In  some  developed  countries  and  communities,  affluence  leads  to  high  levels  of  consumption  and emissions across sectors (Wiedmann et al. 2020; Mazur and Rosa 1974).

However, some developing countries  still  face  the  challenge  of  escaping  &#8220;middle-income  traps&#8221;  (Ag&#233;nor  and  Canuto  2015),  as labour-saving  technological  change  and  globalisation  have  limited  options  to  develop  via  the manufacturing  sector  (Altenburg  and  Rodrik  2017).  In  least  developed  countries,  infrastructure, industry, and public services are still being established, posing both a challenge to financial support to deploy  technologies,  and  large  opportunities  to  support  accelerating  low-to-zero  carbon  options (especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision, (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020)).

They are also vital to guide and provide the other enabling conditions (cf. Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the potential  to  achieve  multiple  mitigation  and  development  objectives.  Finance  is  required  both  to accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near-term actions to shift the financial system over the next decade (2021-2030) are critically important and feasible, and that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to trillions  (15.6.7)  (Mawdsley  2018).

On the contrary, stringent temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term (Rockstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) to enforce effective existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or remove harmful existing policies and subsidies (D&#237;az et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id19817"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19818">Policy integration, addressing multiple objectives, is an essential component of shifting development pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation  (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19820">robust  evidence,  high  agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19821">).

Focused national climate institutions to address these challenges are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they are consistent with a framing of climate change that has broad national political support (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20013">medium evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20015">) (4.5, 13.2, 13.5).  </span></div><div style="" id="id20017"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20018">Innovative governance approaches can help meet these challenges (Clark et al. 2018; D&#237;az et al. 2019). </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20020">Enabling multilevel governance</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20021">&#8212;i.e., better alignment across governance scales&#8212;and coordination of international  organisations  and  national  governments  can  help  accelerate  a  transition  to  sustainable development and deep decarbonisation (Tait and Euston-Brown 2017; Michaelowa and Michaelowa </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20025">2017;  Ringel  2017;  Revi  2017;  Cheshmehzangi  2016;  IPCC  2018a).  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20026">Participatory  and  inclusive governance</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20028">&#8212;partnerships between state and non-state actors&#8212;, and concerted effort across different stakeholders are crucial in supporting acceleration (Roberts 2016; Hering et al. 2014; Figueres et al. 2017; Leal Filho et al. 2018; Burch et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2018; Clark et al. 2018).

Financial systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). Policy frameworks can re-direct financial resources towards low-emission assets and services (UNEP 2015), mainstreaming climate finance within financial and banking system regulation, and reducing transaction costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 2013; Brunner and Enting 2014; Yeo 2019).

There is a growing recognition that new forms of innovation can be harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). As such, innovation  and  sociotechnical  change  can  be  channelled  to  intensify  mitigation  via  &#8220;deliberate acceleration&#8221; (Roberts et al. 2018a) and &#8220;coalition building&#8221; (Hess 2018).  </span></div><div style="" id="id20754"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20755">Innovation goes beyond technology. For example, decarbonisation in sectors with long lived capital stock  (such  as  heavy  industry,  buildings,  transport  infrastructure)  entail  technology,  policy  and financing innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment of photovoltaics can draw upon policies that support specific technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g., net-metering), to innovations in social organisation (e.g., community-ownership). System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin et al. 2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low carbon transitions not only involves a shift  of  system  elements  but  also  underlying  routines  and  rules,  and  hence  transitions  shift  the directionality of innovation.

More fundamentally, innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven by monetizable profits (as much of private sector led technological innovation of patentable intellectual property), or prioritise social returns (e.g., innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public sector </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20778">innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial intellectual property regimes).

In China, for example, the shift away from heavy industry (to light industry and services) has already been identified as the most important force limiting emissions growth (Guan et al. 2018), and as a major factor for future emissions (Kwok et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id20928"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20929">Overall,  Altenburg  et  al.

They argue that this dual challenge calls for structural transformation policies different from those implemented in the past, most importantly through a &#8220;systematic steering of investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction&#8221; and encompassing policy coordination (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20935">limited evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20936">). </span></div><div style="" id="id20938"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20939">In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential that countries develop visions of their future decarbonised sectoral production structure, including its ability to generate growth in incomes, employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the related spatial distribution of production, employment,  and  housing.  To  this  extent,  governance  and  institutional  capacity  matter,  such  as availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure that permits strong growth is essential given strong associations between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs (including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to water, sanitation, electricity, and roads; but not income equality), in part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households and governments with resources that at least in part would be used to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015). </span></div><div style="" id="id20949"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20950">The  future  viability  of  sectors  will  depend  on  the  extent  to  which  they  can  remain  profitable  while relying on lower-carbon energy.

The 1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early example in which environmental taxation (including, but not limited to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily aimed at lowering the marginal tax  rates  (more  than  80% at  the  time), at  reducing  other taxes,  while  keeping  most  of  the welfare  state.  To  do  so,  the  tax  base  was  broadened,  including  through  environmental  and  carbon taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and its base broadened (Criqui et al. 2019). </span></div><div style="" id="id21129"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21130">The  future potential for  using carbon taxation as a  way  to  provide space for  fiscal  reform  has  been highlighted in the so-called &#8220;green fiscal reform&#8221; literature (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019). The potential is large, since only 13 percent of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 (Watts et al. 2019) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, the  global  subsidy  value  amounted  to  $427  billion,  i.e.,  some  10  times  the  payment  for  carbon  use (Watts et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies. </span></div><div style="" id="id21139"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21140">The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of higher carbon prices are immediate  (Karapin 2016). Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans.

(Haites  2018)  suggests  that  since  2008,  other  policies  have  probably  contributed  more  to  emission reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives.

<div style="" id="id21300"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21301">The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), as  well as momentum  from  climate actions  by other  countries and international  climate  agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al 2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon  energy:  when  they  are  low,  consumer  resistance  would  be  smaller  since  prices  will  remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow-down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Withana &amp; Sirini 2016). In countries that exports carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers. </span></div><div style="" id="id21312"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21313">There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers  or  earmarked  for  areas  with  positive  environmental  effects  (e.g.,  (Bachus  et  al.  2019)  for Belgium,  and  (Beiser-McGrath  and  Bernauer  2019)  for  Germany  and  the  USA),  as  well  as  on  the difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the introduction of such instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, &#8220;best practice&#8221; have been drawn from past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Sovacool 2017; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). Specific policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) (Kettner et al. 2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy. </span></div><div style="" id="id21327"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21328">In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and may  not  be  sufficient  to  address  the  other  objectives  pursued.  Even  if  the  carbon  price  is  high,  the revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. (2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21338">of 0.93 percent in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric ton of CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id21339">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21340">, to 0.48 per cent in 2018, when  the rate  had reached  USD132  (Jonsson  et  al.  2020;  Statistics  Sweden  2020).

Patterns of urbanisation, territorial development, and regional integration have wide-ranging implications for economic, social and environmental objectives (World Bank 2009). Notably, choices regarding spatial forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for transportation and associated GHG emissions. </span></div><div style="" id="id21492"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21493">Exclusionary  mechanisms  such  as  decreasing  accessibility  and  affordability  of  inner-urban neighbourhoods  is  a  major  cause  of  suburbanisation  of  low-  to  middle-income  households  (e.g., (Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 2014). Similarly,  other  studies  find  a  significant  positive  link  between  housing  prices  and  energy  demand (Lampin et al. 2013). </span></div><div style="" id="id21500"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21501">Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate policy instruments (e.g., through a carbon tax) is more difficult when inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, because exclusionary mechanisms act as a countervailing force to the rising transportation costs induced by the climate policy, pushing households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs of mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when inner-urban housing prices are higher (Lampin et al. 2013). </span></div><div style="" id="id21508"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21509">This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable can  open  up  broader  opportunities  for  suburban  households  to  relocate  in  the  face  of  increasing transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs&#8212;e.g., households feeling helpless in front of rising fuel prices&#8212;and the economic costs of mitigation policies&#8212;as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust. </span></div><div style="" id="id21518"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21519">Making  inner-cities  neighbourhoods  more  accessible  and  more  affordable  is  a  complex  endeavour (Benner and Karner 2016). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic reasons. Revenues derived from climate policies could provide additional resources to support such programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income groups (Karner and Marcantonio 2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (Grant 2015; </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21528">IADB  2012;  Khosla  and  Bhardwaj  2019).

With  careful management,  shifting  development  pathways  can  build  greater  adaptive  and  mitigative  capacity,  as further  confirmed  in  recent  literature  (Schramski  et  al.  2018;  Harvey  et  al.  2014;  Ebi  et  al.  2014; Rosenbloom et al. 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Singh 2018; IPBES 2019b).

Implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions can, however, encounter different sets of challenges. Mitigation actions requiring a shift away from established sectors and resources (e.g., fossil fuels) entail governance challenges to overcome vested interests (SEI et al. 2020; Piggot et al. 2020).

Indeed, there are conceptual formulations for these practices in which the co-benefits are more of a focus, such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) which ties mitigation to adaptation through its three pillars of increased productivity, mitigation, and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014). The &#8216;4 per 1000&#8217; goal to increase soil carbon by 0.4% per year (Soussana et al. 2019) is compatible with the three pillars of CSA. Sustainable intensification, a framework which centers around a need for increased agricultural production  within  environmental  constraints  also  complements  CSA  (Campbell  et  al.  2014).

Availability of foreign financial resources in countries with limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of technology transfers (Glachant and Dechezlepr&#234;tre 2017) are some examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on domestic action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading partners, the lack of which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to international competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices of the key commodities (notably energy), goods and services are important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on structural change (e.g., Willenbockel et al. (2017) for Ghana and Kenya). </span></div><div style="" id="id22829"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22830">Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the extent possible, robust to uncertainty regarding  external  decisions.

Remedies also include securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty that domestic decision-makers face about the international context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities and financing  of  transitions  (15.6),  which  can  enable  shifting  development  pathways.  Cooperation  can generate positive spill overs through technology diffusion (13.6.6). Third, cooperation is not limited to governments. As discussed in section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-State actors (cities,  economic  branches,  etc.)  can  also  provide  know-how,  resources  and  stable  cooperative frameworks that reduce uncertainty for individual actors (14.5.5). </span></div><div style="" id="id22842"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22843">4.4.3.2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22845">Parts of complex policy packages fail </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22847">As outlined in the examples in section 4.4.1 above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how from the past. An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages may fail, i.e., under-deliver relative to the amount of mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, France has failed to meet its 2015-2018 carbon budget as housing retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). There are two main options to tackle this risk. The first is to build in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the policies will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective mechanisms in a sequential decision-making </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22856">process.

Even though decisions are no longer made &#8220;in a sea of uncertainty&#8221; (Lave 1991), we know that  new  information  will  come  over  time,  that  may  have  significant  bearing  on  the  design  and objectives of policies to shift development pathways and accelerate mitigation. New information may come from climate sciences (e.g., updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018), impact sciences (e.g., re-evaluation of climate impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke et  al.  2018)  or  mitigation  sciences  (e.g.,  on  availability  of  given  technologies)  (Lenzi  et  al.  2018; Giannousakis et al. 2020).  </span></div><div style="" id="id22989"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22990">At the same time, economic and social systems are characterised by high degree of inertia, via long-lived capital stock or urban forms  (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014), or more broadly mutually reinforcing physical, economic, and social constraints (Seto et al. 2016) that may lead to carbon lock-ins (Erickson et al. 2015). Risks associated with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of particular attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate that even if the current pipeline of power plants was cancelled, about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain compatible with 1.5&#176;C or  2&#176;C  pathways&#8212;implying  that  additional  capital  accumulation  would  lead  to  higher  sunk  costs associated with stranded assets (Luderer et al. 2018b; Johnson et al. 2015; Ansar et al. 2013; Kriegler et al. 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id23000"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23001">In the presence of uncertainty and inertia (or irreversibilities), hedging strategies may be considered, that include selection of risk-hedging strategies and processes to adjust decisions as new information becomes available. The notion of hedging against risks is also prominent in the adaptation literature, as exemplified by the terminology of &#8220;climate resilient development&#8221; (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016) (WGII, Ch.18). There is also a growing literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g., firms or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with mitigation (e.g., policy uncertainty or the associated carbon price uncertainty) (e.g., (Morris et al. 2018) or (Andersson et al. 2016)). On the other hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of its implication for hedging strategies in the accelerated  mitigation  pathway  literature.  Exceptions  include  (Capros  et  al.  2019),  who  elicit  &#8220;no-regret&#8221;  and  &#8220;disruptive&#8221;  mitigation  options  for  the  EU  through  a  detailed  sensitivity  analysis,  and (Watson et al. 2015) who discuss flexible strategies for the U.K. energy sector transition in the face of multiple uncertainties. </span></div><div style="" id="id23014"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23015">4.4.3.4</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23017">Black swans (e.g., COVID-19 crisis) </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23019">As  the  current  COVID-19  crisis  demonstrates,  events  happen  that  can  derail  the  best-laid  plans.

The only point to note here is that such events may also provide </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23023">opportunities. In the COVID-19 case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint on how some of these activities are carried out in the post-COVID-19 world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action. However, the emissions implications  of  recovery  packages  depend  on  choosing  policies  that  support  climate  action  while addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn et al. 2020). Governments may be in a stronger position to do so due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses during the pandemics. Given the magnitude of recovery packages and their implications (Pollitt et al. 2021), choosing  the  direction  of  recovery  packages  amounts  to  choosing  a  development  pathway  (Cross-Chapter Box 1). </span></div><div style="" id="id23044"/>

They require a credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive just transition (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such processes  are  designed  to  manage  the  risk  of  inequitable  or  non-representative  power  dynamics (Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). More generally, stakeholder processes can  be  subject  to  regulatory  capture  by  special  interests,  or  outright  opposition  from  a  variety  of stakeholders.  Information  asymmetry  between  government  and  business  may  shape  the  results  of consultative processes. Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The next section on Just Transition (4.5) addresses this issue. </span></div><div style="" id="id23117"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id23118">4.5</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id23120">Equity, including just transitions </span></div><div style="" id="id23122"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23123">Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is also instrumentally an enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports a range of estimates of the net benefits&#8212;globally or nationally&#8212;of low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a number  of  difficulties  in  drawing  definitive  quantitative  conclusions  (e.g.,  comparisons  of  costs  &amp; benefits  among  different  actors,  the  existence  of  non-economic  impacts,  comparison  across  time, uncertainty  in  magnitude,  3.6).  One  of  the  most  important  of  these  dimensions  is  the  distributional consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity considerations arising from the uncertainty in net benefits, as well as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and losers (Rendall 2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et al.  2017).  Some  equity  approaches  are  even  just  seeking  corrective  justice  including  for  historical emissions (Adler 2007). For an assessment of literature on fairness in NDCs, see 4.2.2.7. </span></div><div style="" id="id23135"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23136">Equity issues are often discussed in the literature via frameworks that are well-founded in the ethical literature and that have a strong bearing on effort-sharing, but have not yet been quantitatively modelled and expressed in the form of an emissions allocation quantified framework. These include, for example, ethical perspectives based in human rights (Johl and Duyck 2012), human capabilities (Klinsky et al. 2017b), environmental justice (Mohai et al. 2009; Schlosberg 2009), ecological debt (Srinivasana et al. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23142">2008; Warlenius  et al. 2015),  transitional justice  (Klinsky  2017;  Klinsky  and  Brankovic  2018),  and planetary boundaries (H&#228;yh&#228; et al. 2016).  </span></div><div style="" id="id23145"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23146">While there is extensive literature on equity frameworks for national emissions allocations (CSO Equity Review  2018,  2015,  2017;  Kemp-Benedict  et  al.  2018;  Pye  et  al.  2020;  Robiou  du  Pont  and Meinshausen 2018; Fyson et al. 2020; Holz et al. 2018; Pozo et al. 2020), such studies have tended to focus on allocation of a global carbon budget among countries based on quantified equity frameworks. The implicit normative choices made in these analysis have limitations (Kartha et al. 2018a). Moreover, there  are  many  ethical  parameters  that  could  be  introduced  to  enrich  the  existing  quantitative frameworks,  such  as  progressivity  (Holz  et  al.  2018),  consumption-based  accounting  (Afionis  et  al. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23154">2017),  prioritarianism  (Adler  and  Treich  2015),  and  a  right  to  development  (Moellendorf  2020).

The literature suggests a relationship between the effectiveness of cooperative action and the perception of fairness of such arrangements. Winkler et al. (2018) demonstrate that countries have put forward a wide variety of indicators and approaches for explaining the fairness and ambition of their NDCs, reflecting the broader range of perspectives found in the moral philosophical literature cited above. Mbeva and Pauw (2016) further find that adaptation and financing issues take on greater salience in the national perspectives reflected in the NDCs. </span></div><div style="" id="id23356"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23357">Topics of equity and fairness have begun to receive a greater amount of attention within the energy and climate literature, namely through the approaches of gender and race (Pearson et al. 2017; Lennon 2017; Allen et al. 2019), climate justice (Roberts and Parks 2007; Routledge et al. 2018) (Roberts &amp; Parks, 2006; Routledge et al. 2018), and energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2014). While such approaches frequently envision justice and equity as an ethical imperative, justice also possesses the instrumental value of enabling deeper and more socially acceptable mitigation efforts (Klinsky and Winkler 2018). </span></div><div style="" id="id23364"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23365">A concrete focal point on these issues has been that of &#8220;just transition&#8221;. Getting broad consensus for the transformational changes entailed in moving from a high- to a low-carbon economy means &#8216;leaving no one  behind&#8217;,  i.e.,  ensuring  (sufficiently)  equitable  transition  for  the  relevant  affected  individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Newell &amp; Mulvaney, 2013; Jasanoff 2018). The concept of a &#8220;just transition&#8221; owes its origin to the US trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest version of a just transition was called the &#8220;Superfund for Workers&#8221; modelled on the 1980 Superfund program that designed federal funds for the clean-up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and energy production (Stevis and Felli 2015). It was further taken up, for example in the collaboration of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in promoting &#8220;green jobs&#8221; as integral elements of a just transition (ILO 2015; Rosemberg 2015). In recent years the concept of a &#8220;just transition&#8221; has gained increased traction, for  example  incorporated  in  the  outcome of the  Rio+20  Earth  Summit and more recently  recognised  in  the  preamble  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  states  &#8220;the  imperative  of  a  just transition  of  the  workforce  and  the  creation  of  decent  work  and  quality  jobs  in  accordance  with nationally  defined  development  priorities&#8221;  (UNFCCC  2015c).

While  the  precise  definition  varies  by  source,  core  elements  tend  to  include:  (1)  investments  in establishing low-emission and  labour-intensive technologies and sectors  (Mijn Cha  et  al.  2020);  (2) research and early assessment of the social and employment impacts of climate policies  (Green and Gambhir  2020;  Mogomotsi  et  al.  2018);  (3)  social  dialogue  and  democratic  consultation  of  social partners and stakeholders (Smith 2017; Swilling and Annecke 2012); (4) the creation of decent jobs; active labour markets policies; and rights at work (UNFCCC 2016c; ILO 2015); (5) fairness in energy </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23396">access  and  use  (Carley  and  Konisky  2020);  (6)  economic  diversification  based  on  low-carbon investments;  (7)  realistic  training/retraining  programs  that  lead  to  decent  work;  (8)  gender  specific politics that promote equitable outcomes (Allwood 2020); (9) the fostering of international cooperation </span></div><div style="" id="id23410"/><div style="" id="id23456"/><div style="" id="id23459"/><div style="" id="id23462"/><div style="" id="id23510"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23511">and coordinated multilateral actions (Lenferna 2018b; Newell and Simms 2020); (10) redressing of past harms and perceived injustices (UNHRC 2020; Setzer and Vanhala 2019); and (11) consideration of inter-generational  justice  concerns,  such  as  the  impacts  of  policy  decisions  on  future  generations (Newell &amp; Mulvaney, 2013). </span></div><div style="" id="id23516"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23517">A  just  transition  could  therefore  entail  that  the  state  intervenes  more  actively  in  the  eradication  of poverty,  and  creates  jobs  in  lower-carbon  sectors,  in  part  to  compensate  for  soon-to-be  abandoned fossil-fuel-based sectors, and that governments, polluting industries, corporations and those more able to  pay  higher  associated  taxes  pay  for  transition  costs,  provide  a  welfare  safety  net  and  adequate compensation  for  people,  communities,  places,  and  regions  that  have  been  impacted  by  pollution, marginalised or negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society (Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Le Billon and Kristoffersen 2020; Kartha et al. 2018b).

Processes established in the name of a just transition are  also  at  risk  of  being  co-opted  by  incumbent  interests  and  powerful/wealthy  agents  (Green  and Gambhir, 2020). Policy interventions associated with good governance, democratic oversight, and legal recourse  can  help  overcome  attempted  co-optation  of  just  transition,  or  use  of  COVID-19  recovery packages for continued carbon lock-in (Hepburn et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020).</span></div><div style="" id="id23535"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23536">The  just  transition  concept  has  thus  become  an  international  focal  point  tying  together  social movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon transitions and to seek to protect workers and communities. It also forms a central pillar of the growing movement for a &#8216;Green New Deal&#8217;&#8212;a roadmap for a broad spectrum of policies, programs, and legislation that aims to rapidly decarbonises the economy while significantly reducing economic inequality (Galvin and Healy 2020)(Allam et al. 2021) The US Green New Deal Resolution (Ocasio-Cortez 2019) for example positions structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and a just transition at its centre. The European Green Deal proposed in 2019 (European Commission 2019), including a UDF100 billion &#8220;Just Transition Mechanism&#8221; to mitigate the social effects of transitioning away from jobs in fossil based industries.

For  instance,  the  German  phase-out  of  coal  subsidies  involved  a  savings  package  for unemployed miners. Subsidy reform packages introduced by Iran, Namibia, the Philippines, Turkey, and the United Kingdom provide similar compensating measures to affected groups (Sovacool 2017). Spain&#8217;s just transition plan for coal miners includes early retirement, redundancy packages, silicosis compensation, retraining for green jobs, and priority job placement for former miners. </span></div><div style="" id="id23882"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id23883">4.6</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 14px;" id="id23885">Knowledge gaps </span></div><div style="" id="id23887"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23888">This section summarises knowledge gaps that require further research: </span></div><div style="" id="id23890"><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23891">&#8226;</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23893">Literature on mitigation pathways at the national level remains skewed towards large emitters.
