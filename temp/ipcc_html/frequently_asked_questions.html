To cover up for these shortfalls will require taking actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions include shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing &#8216;green infrastructure&#8217;, such  as  building  green  roofs,  or  improving  energy  efficiency  by  smart  urban  planning,  which  will change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions are connected, it means all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24120">of  successful  implementation  (4.2.5).  The  deployment  of  low-emission  technology  depends  upon </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24122">economic  conditions  (e.g.,  employment  generation  or  capacity  to  mobilize  investment),  but  also  on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support  and  understanding),  and  the  provision  of  relevant  enabling  conditions  (4.4.1).  Encouraging stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and subnational stakeholders, as well as  international  cooperative  initiatives  (ICIs)  could  make  significant  contributions  to  emissions reduction (4.2.3). </span></div><div style="" id="id24129"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24130">FAQ  4.2  Option  1:  What  is  to  be  done  in  the  near-term  to  accelerate  mitigation  and  shift development pathways?  </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24133">Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction faces important obstacles, that are rooted in the underlying structure of societies (4.2.7). Addressing these obstacles amounts to shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5). This can be done by strengthening governance and institutional capacity, aligning technology and innovation systems with low-carbon development, facilitating  behaviour  change  and  providing  adequate  finance  within  the  context  of  multi-objective policy packages and sequences (4.4.1). Shifting development pathways towards sustainability broadens the scope for, and is thus a complement to, accelerated mitigation (4.3). </span></div><div style="" id="id24142"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24143">FAQ 4.3 Is it possible to accelerate mitigation in the near-term while there are so many other </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24145">development priorities? (education, health, employment, etc.)</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24146"> It is possible to accelerate mitigation while addressing other developmental priorities by implementing measures that simultaneously address both climate and development goals.  Casting mitigation in the broader context of development pathways provides additional opportunities to articulate both (4.3.1.4). Policies  such  as  progressive  taxation,  investment  in  public  transport,  regulatory  transparency, commitment  to  multi-lateral  environmental  governance,  fiscal  incentives  for  private  investments, international technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve underlying enabling conditions (improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change  and  technological  innovation,  and  provision  of  finance)  address  multiple  objectives  beyond </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24156">mitigation, such as job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, public health and welfare, providing energy access, providing formal housing, and providing mobility.

In turn, reducing GHG emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health and wellbeing, and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to address the challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in land use, widespread planting of a single tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if bioenergy is to be relied upon to offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17). </span></div><div style="" id="id24315"/><div style="" id="id24358"><a name="108" id="id24359">Page 108</a></div>
