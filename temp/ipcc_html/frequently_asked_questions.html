conditions for support (4.2.2.3). To cover up for these shortfalls will require taking actions across all 
sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions include shifting to low- 
or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes 
away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing &#8216;green infrastructure&#8217;, 
such  as  building  green  roofs,  or  improving  energy  efficiency  by  smart  urban  planning,  which  will 
change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions are connected, it means all relevant 
companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance

social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political 
support  and  understanding),  and  the  provision  of  relevant  enabling  conditions  (4.4.1).  Encouraging 
stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and subnational stakeholders, as well 
as  international  cooperative  initiatives  (ICIs)  could  make  significant  contributions  to  emissions 
reduction (4.2.3).

development pathways?  
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id24133">Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of 
emission reduction faces important obstacles, that are rooted in the underlying structure of societies 
(4.2.7). Addressing these obstacles amounts to shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., 
shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5). This can be done by strengthening governance 
and institutional capacity, aligning technology and innovation systems with low-carbon development, 
facilitating  behaviour  change  and  providing  adequate  finance  within  the  context  of  multi-objective 
policy packages and sequences (4.4.1). Shifting development pathways towards sustainability broadens 
the scope for, and is thus a complement to, accelerated mitigation (4.3).

It is possible to accelerate mitigation while addressing other developmental priorities by implementing 
measures that simultaneously address both climate and development goals.  Casting mitigation in the 
broader context of development pathways provides additional opportunities to articulate both (4.3.1.4). 
Policies  such  as  progressive  taxation,  investment  in  public  transport,  regulatory  transparency, 
commitment  to  multi-lateral  environmental  governance,  fiscal  incentives  for  private  investments, 
international technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve 
underlying enabling conditions (improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural 
change  and  technological  innovation,  and  provision  of  finance)  address  multiple  objectives  beyond

emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health and wellbeing, 
and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to 
address the challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in 
land use, widespread planting of a single tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into 
renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if bioenergy is to be relied upon to 
offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17).
