This would entail a significant capital loss for the countries with large reserves. The total amount of stranded assets in such a case would amount to USD 1&#8211;4 trillion at present value (Box 6.13).  </span></li><li><span>). The main perceived advantage of fossil energy is the relatively low costs, and emphasizing these costs might increase acceptability somewhat (Pohjolainen et al. 2018; Hazboun and Boudet 2020; Boyd et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil fuels is on average similar to acceptability of nuclear energy, although evaluations are less polarized. People evaluate natural gas as somewhat more acceptable than other fossil fuels, although they generally oppose hydraulic fracturing (Clarke et al. 2016). Yet, natural gas is evaluated as less acceptable than renewable energy sources, although evaluations of natural gas and biogas are similar (Liebe and Dobers 2019; Plum et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil energy tends to be higher in countries and regions that strongly rely on them for their energy production (Boyd et al. 2019; Pohjolainen et al. 2018). Combining fossil fuels with </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id9511_1">CCS</a><span> can increase their acceptability (Van Rijnsoever et al. 2015; Bessette and Arvai 2018). Some people seem ambivalent about natural gas, as they perceive both benefits (e.g., affordability, less carbon emissions than coal) and disadvantages (e.g., finite resource, contributing to climate change) (Blumer et al. 2018).  </span></li><li><span>Depending on the origin of the waste used, the integration of WTE and carbon capture and storage (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id10094_1">CCS</a><span>) could enable waste to be a net zero or even net negative emissions energy source (Kearns 2019; Wienchol et al. 2020).

For  example,  one  study  found  that  flexibility  technologies  and advanced control systems could reduce the need for nuclear power by 14 GW and offshore wind by 20 GW in the UK&#8217;s low-carbon transition (Strbac et al. 2015b). </span></li><li><span>Dinkelacker 2018) generally refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas combined with </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id13876_1">CCS</a><span> through processes such as steam methane reforming (</span></li><li><span>)(Sanusi and Mokheimer 2019) and advanced gas reforming (Zhou et al. 2020).

Further, biomass gasification could produce renewable hydrogen, and when joined with </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id13876_22">CCS</a><span> could provide negative carbon emissions. &#8220;Green&#8221; hydrogen (Jaszczur et al. 2016) most often is referred to as hydrogen produced from zero-carbon electricity sources such as solar  power and wind power  (Schmidt  et  al.  2017)  (Table  6.8).  Nuclear  power  could  also  provide  clean  hydrogen,  via electrolysis or thermochemical water splitting (EERE 2020). Hydrogen can even be produced pyrolysis of  methane  (S&#225;nchez-Bastardo  et  al.  2020),  sometimes  called  as  &#8220;turquoise&#8221;  hydrogen,  solar thermochemical water splitting, biological hydrogen production (cyanobacteria) (Velazquez Abad and Dodds 2017), and microbes that use light to make hydrogen (under research)(EIA 2020).  </span></li><li><span>Table 6.7 Key performance and cost characteristics of different non-electric hydrogen production technologies (including </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id13892_1">CCS</a><span>)</span></li><li><span>To bypass gas infrastructure in transporting hydrogen, methane can be transported using the existing gas infrastructure, while hydrogen can be produced close to the demand centres.

Further, end users, including consumers, governments, businesses and industry, would need to adopt the relevant options, and then use these as intended; user adoption can be a key driver to scale up markets for low carbon technologies.

In Asia, planned coal capacity is expected to be vulnerable to droughts, sea level rise, and rising air temperatures, and this may be exacerbated by incorporating carbon capture (Wang et al. 2019c). Recently, however, studies have proposed designs of </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id20020_4">CCS</a><span> with a minimal increase in water requirements (Mikunda et al. 2021; Magneschi et al. 2017).  </span></li><li><span>,  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id21364_4">CCS</a><span>)  are  less  than  non-fossil  energy.  For  most  applications,  however,  it  is  likely  that electrification (McCollum et al. 2014; Madeddu et al. 2020; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) or use of non-fossil alternative fuels (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011; H&#228;nggi et al. 2019; Ueckerdt et al. 2021)  will  prove  to  be  the  cheapest  options.  Most  residual  demand  for  fossil  fuels  is  likely  to predominantly be petroleum and natural gas given their high energy density (Davis et al. 2018), while demand for coal in net zero energy systems is likely to be very low  (Luderer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020, Section 6.7.4) (</span></li><li><span>)  (Figure  6.22,  Section  6.7.4).  This  will  be determined by the relative value of such fuels as compared to systems which rely more or less heavily on zero-emissions electricity. In turn, the share of any fuels that are fossil or fossil-derived is uncertain and  will  depend  on  the  feasibility  of  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id21382_1">CCS</a><span>  and  </span></li><li><span>(e.g.,  nuclear,  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id21415_1">CCS</a><span>-equipped  capacity),  energy  storage,  transmission,  carbon  removal  options  (e.g., </span></li><li><span>) (Figure 6.22). While wind and solar will likely be prominent electricity resources, this does not imply that 100% renewable  energy systems will  be  pursued  under  all circumstances,  since  economic  and  operational challenges increase nonlinearly as shares approach 100% (Box 6.8) (Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Cole et al. 2021; Shaner et al. 2018; Frew et al. 2016; Imelda et al. 2018b). Real-world experience planning and  operating  regional  electricity  systems  with  high  instantaneous  and  annual  shares  of  renewable generation is accumulating, but debates continue about how much wind and solar should be included in different systems, and the cost-effectiveness of mechanisms for managing variability (Box 6.8).

In addition to renewables, studies broadly agree that including additional low-carbon options &#8211; including not only low-carbon electricity but also targeted use of fossil fuels with and without </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id22018_1">CCS</a><span> (Section 6.6.2.1) and alternative fuels for sectors that are difficult to electrify (Section 6.6.2.4) &#8211; can lower the cost of decarbonization even with very high shares of renewables (Figure 6.22).

Process and boiler heating in industrial facilities are anticipated to be electrified in net zero energy systems. Emissions intensity reductions for cement  and  concrete  production  can  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  electrified  cement  kilns,  while emissions associated with steel production can be reduced through the use of an electric arc furnace (EAF)  powered  by decarbonized  electricity  (Rissman  et  al.).  Electricity can also  be  used  to replace thermal heat such as resistive heating, electric arc furnaces, and laser sintering (Rissman et al.; Madeddu et al. 2020). One study found that as much as 60% of the energy end-use in European industry could be met with direct electrification using existing and emerging technologies (Madeddu et al. 2020). Industry electrification  for  different  regions  will  depend  on  the  economics  and  availability  of  alternative emissions mitigation strategies such as carbon neutral fuels and </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id22377_1">CCS</a><span> (Davis et al. 2018; Madeddu et al. 2020). </span></li><li><span> emissions and without fossil fuel inputs (Sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.5). For example, liquid hydrocarbons can be synthesized via hydrogenation of non-fossil carbon by processes such as Fischer-Tropsch (Mac Dowell et al. 2017) or by conversion of biomass (Tilman et al. 2009). The resulting energy-dense fuels can serve applications that are difficult to electrify, but it is not clear if and when the combined costs of obtaining necessary feedstocks and producing these fuels without fossil inputs will be less than continuing to use fossil fuels and managing the related carbon through, for example, </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id22405_1">CCS</a><span> or </span></li><li><span>For hydrogen to support decarbonisation, it will need to be produced from zero-carbon or extremely low-carbon  energy  sources.

Coordinated  operation  of  gas  and  electricity  systems  can  bring  significant  benefits  in supplying  heat  demands.  For  example,  hybrid  heating  can  eliminate  investment  in  electricity infrastructure reinforcement by switching to heat pumps in off-peak hours and gas boilers in peak hours ( Dengiz et al. 2019; Fischer et al. 2017; Bistline et al. 2021). The heat required by direct air carbon capture and storage (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id10235_4">DACCS</a><span>) could be effectively supplied by inherent heat energy in nuclear plants, enhancing overall system efficiency (Realmonte et al. 2019). </span></li><li><span> used to produce them would need to come from the atmosphere either directly through </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id14620_1">DACCS</a><span> or indirectly through </span></li><li><span> or </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id20780_7">DACCS</a><span> can be used to store CO</span></li><li><span> options, such as </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id20783_7">DACCS</a><span>, would be important energy consumers (Bistline and Blanford 2021a, 6.6.2).

Coordinated  operation  of  gas  and  electricity  systems  can  bring  significant  benefits  in supplying  heat  demands.  For  example,  hybrid  heating  can  eliminate  investment  in  electricity infrastructure reinforcement by switching to heat pumps in off-peak hours and gas boilers in peak hours ( Dengiz et al. 2019; Fischer et al. 2017; Bistline et al. 2021).

There  are already important developments in increasing nuclear plants flexibility (e.g., in France (Office of Nuclear Energy 2021)) and the development of small modular reactors, which could support system balancing (FTI Consulting 2018).  </span></li><li><span>  The  transition  from  conventional  electricity  generation, applying  mainly  synchronous  machines  to  inverter-dominated  renewable  generation,  creates significant operating challenges. These challenges are mainly associated with reduced synchronous inertia, system stability, and black start capability. Grid-forming converters will be a cornerstone for the control of future electricity systems dominated by </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id10479_1">VRE</a><span> generation. These converters will address  critical  stability  challenges,  including  the  lack  of  system  inertia,  frequency  and  voltage regulation, and black-start services while reducing or eliminating the need to operate conventional generation (Tayyebi et al. 2019).  </span></li><li><span>Energy storage technologies make low carbon electricity systems more cost-effective, allowing </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id10856_1">VRE</a><span> technologies to replace more expensive firm low carbon generation technologies (Carbon Trust 2016) and  reducing  investment  costs  in  backup  generation,  interconnection,  transmission,  and  distribution network upgrades (</span></li><li><span>).  The  diurnal  and  seasonal  characteristics  of  different  renewable  energy  sources  such  as wind,  solar,  and  hydropower  can  vary  significantly  by  location.  Through  enhanced  electricity transmission infrastructure, more wind turbines can be deployed in areas with high wind potential and more solar panels in areas with larger solar irradiation. Increases in electricity transmission and trade can also enhance operational efficiency and reduce or defer the need for investment in peaking plants, storage,  or  other  load  management  techniques  needed  to  meet  security  of  supply  requirements associated  with  localized  use  of  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id14993_1">VRE</a><span>  sources.  Increased  interconnectivity  of  large-scale  grids  also allows the aggregation of &#8216;smart grid&#8217; solutions such as flexible heating and cooling devices for flexible demand in industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors (Hakimi et al. 2020) and </span></li><li><span>s are useful because they normalize the costs per unit of service provided. While useful in characterizing options in broad strokes, it is important to acknowledge and understand several caveats associated with these  metrics,  particularly  when  applied  globally.  They  may  be  constructed  with  different  discount rates; they require information on energy input costs for options that require energy inputs (e.g., fossil electricity generation, biofuels); they depend on local resource availability, for example solar insolation for solar power, wind classes for wind power, and rainfall and streamflow for hydropower; and actual implementation costs may include additional elements, for example, the costs of managing electricity grids heavily dependent on </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id15607_4">VRE</a><span> electricity sources.

An increasingly large set of studies examines the feasibility of high renewable penetration and economic drivers under different policy, technology, and market scenarios (Denholm et al. 2021; Blanford et al. 2021; Bistline et al. 2019; Hansen et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Cochran et al. 2014; Dowling et al. 2020; Deason 2018). High wind and solar penetration involves technical and economic challenges due to their unique characteristics  such  as  spatial  and  temporal  variability,  short-  and  long-term  uncertainty,  and  non-synchronous  generation  (Cole  et  al.  2017).

At least 30%  of  the  global  final  energy  needs  are  expected  to  be  served  by  electricity,  with  some  estimates suggesting  upwards  of  80%  of  total  energy  use  being  electrified  (Figure  6.22,  panel  c).

China's coal consumption reached a plateau under policy efforts during the 13</span></li><li><span> Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), and new coal plants are being built at a slower rate than previously. Both China and India have suspended and cancelled many new coal power projects and retired a small set of old, dirty, inefficient coal plants (Global Energy Monitor et al. 2021; CEA 2019). These efforts are largely due to non-climate reasons, such air pollution and health (Singh and Rao 2015; Gass et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Malik et al. 2020), overcapacity (Blondeel and Van de Graaf 2018), and rural electrification and renewable investments (Aklin et al. 2017; Thapar et al. 2018). However,  as  new  builds  offset  retirements,  coal  generation  capacity  has  continued  to  grow  in  both countries  since  2015  (Global  Energy  Monitor  et  al.  2021).  Other  fast-growing  Southeast  Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Philippines have experienced strong growth in coal use (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id3169_1">IEA</a><span> 2020b), but an increasing number of new coal power projects are being cancelled (Littlecott et al. 2021). </span></li><li><span>.

Recycling allows the reuse of nearly all - 83% in one study - of the components of PV modules,  other  than  plastics  (Ardente  et  al.  2019)  and  would  add  less  than  1%  to  lifecycle  GHG emissions (Latunussa et al. 2016). Glass accounts for 70% of the mass of a solar cell and is relatively easy to recycle. Recycling technology is advancing, but the scale and share of recycling is still small (Li et al. 2020d). By 2050, however, end-of-life PV could total 80 MT and comprise 10% of global electronic waste (Stolz and Frischknecht 2017), although most of it is glass. </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id4964_1">IEA</a><span> runs a program to enable PV recycling by sharing best practices to minimise recycling life cycle impacts. Ensuring that a substantial  amount  of  panels  are  recycled  at  end  of  life  will  likely  require  policy  incentives,  as  the market value of the recovered materials, aside from aluminium and copper, is likely to be too low to justify  recycling  on  its  own  (Deng  et  al.  2019).

While approximately 80% of the life-cycle methane emissions in the coal sector occur during underground  mining,  oil  and  gas  emissions  are  spread  throughout  upstream,  midstream,  and downstream stages (IPCC, 2019) (Alvarez et al. 2018). For this reason, methane reductions from coal mining  can  be  accomplished  through  coal  mine  methane  recovery  (where  methane  and  coal  are recovered simultaneously) and from the ventilation air, which can reduce methane emissions by 50&#8211;75% (Singh and Hajra 2018; Zhou et al. 2016). Governments incentivize such operations through a number of emissions trading and offset programs (Haya et al. 2020). Methane emissions in the oil and gas sector can be reduced by leak detection and repair, relevant across varying time scales (hours to decades) and regional scopes (component/facility level to continental) (Fox et al. 2019). Around 50% of the methane emitted from oil and gas infrastructure can be mitigated at net-negative costs; that is, the market price of the recovered methane is higher than the mitigation costs  (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id9076_1">IEA</a><span> 2021e).

The technical potential for electricity generation, depending on the depth, can meet one third to almost three times the global final consumption (based on </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id9634_1">IEA</a><span> database for IPCC). The mismatch between potential  and  developed  geothermal  resources  is  caused  by  high  up-front  costs,  decentralized geothermal heat production, lack of uniformity among geothermal projects, geological uncertainties, and geotechnical risks (IRENA 2017a; Limberger et al. 2018). A limited number of countries have a long history in geothermal. At least in two countries (Iceland and New Zealand), geothermal accounts for  20&#8211;25%  of  electricity  generation  (Spittler  et  al.  2020;  Pan  et  al.  2019).  Furthermore,  in  Iceland approximately 90% of the households are heated with geothermal energy. In Kenya, as of July 2019, geothermal accounted for 734 MW effective capacity spread over 10 power plants and approximately one third of the total installed capacity (Kahlen 2019). </span></li><li><span>Table 6.5 Suitability of low carbon energy storage technologies, in terms of the grid services they can provide, and overall features such as technology maturity, where Low represents an emerging technology; Med represents a maturing technology and High a fully mature technology.

For example, peak energy demand during heatwaves can coincide with reduced  transmission  and  distribution  capacity  at  higher  temperatures.  In  large  cities,  extreme  heat events increase cooling degree days significantly, with the urban heat island effect compounding the impact (Morakinyo et al. 2019). One study found that total electricity consumption at the end of the century in the U.S. could increase on average by 20% during summer months and decrease on average by  6%  in  the  winder  (Ralston  Fonseca  et  al.  2019).

Energy security is perceived as a national security issue and often prioritized over climate concerns (Nyman 2018). The linkage between climate and energy security is now widely recognized (Toke and Vezirgiannidou 2013, Fu et al. 2021; La Vi&#241;a et al. 2018; Blarke and Lund  2007;  World  Energy  Council  2020;  United  Nations  2021).  Approaches  to  energy  security are frequently driven by the scope of domestic energy resources. For example, energy security concerns have led to continued reliance on domestic coal production and consumption  (Jakob et al. 2020) and increased  investment  in  domestic  renewable  generation  (Konstantinos  &amp;  Ioannidis,  2017).  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id2467_1">LNG</a><span> Importers have diversified their sources as reliance on </span></li><li><span> Importers have diversified their sources as reliance on </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id2467_4">LNG</a><span> has increased (Vivoda 2019). </span></li><li><span>The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have gone down by utilizing hydraulic fracturing and  directional  drilling  for  resources  in  unconventional  reservoirs  (Wachtmeister  and  H&#246;&#246;k  2020). Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id9284_1">LNG</a><span>) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%.  Natural  gas  liquids  could  potentially  be  a  lower-carbon  alternative  to  liquid  fuels  and hydrocarbons. On the demand side, natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen using steam methane reforming, which is a technologically mature process (Sections 6.4.4, 6.4.5).

Since 2015, the cost of solar PVs has declined by over 60%. Offshore wind costs have fallen by 32%, and onshore wind costs have fallen by 23% (Section 6.4).

Prior to 2010, 50% of all wind capacity was in Europe, but, since then, capacity growth in Asia, led by China, has surpassed the growth in Europe. As a consequence, Europe&#8217;s share in global solar capacity has declined from 74% in 2010 to 24% in 2019. Asia&#8217;s share in wind and solar capacity in 2019 was 41% and 56%, followed by Europe (31% and 24%) and North America (20% and 12%) (IRENA 2021a, 2020a). </span></li><li><span>) for solar PV, roughly double current consumption (Dupont et al. 2020).

Extending  the  life  of  the  battery  can  bring  down  overall  costs  and mitigate  the  environmental  impacts  (Peters  et  al.  2017).  Understanding  and  controlling  battery degradation is therefore important. The liquid, air-reactive electrolytes of conventional </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id12959_1">LIBs</a><span> are the main source of their safety issues (Gur 2018; Janek and Zeier 2016), so All-Solid-State Batteries, in which the electrolyte is a solid, stable material, are being developed. They are expected to be safe, be durable, and have higher energy densities (Janek and Zeier 2016). New chemistries and concepts are being explored, such as lithium-sulfur batteries to achieve even higher energy densities (Van Noorden 2014; Blomgren 2017) and sodium chemistries because sodium is more abundant than lithium (Hwang et al. 2017). Cost-effective recycling of batteries will address many sustainability issues and prevent hazardous and wasteful disposal of used batteries (Harper et al. 2019).

Subsidies and carbon pricing have also played an important role in mainstreaming these renewable energy sources (Best and Burke 2018). Recently, subsidy-free investments in renewables, e.g. wind offshore (Jansen et al. 2020), backed by power purchase agreements, have gained momentum (Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre and BNEF  2020).

In 2020, 61 regional, national and sub-national carbon pricing instruments, representing 22% of the global GHG emissions, were in action or scheduled for implementation (World Bank 2019). Over 51% of emissions covered are priced at less than USD 10 per tCO</span></li><li><span>-e.. At present, however, only 5% of the global emissions covered under carbon pricing initiatives are consistent with the range of carbon prices that have been suggested as needed  to  limit  warming  to  well  below  2&#176;C  (Stiglitz  and  Stern  2017).  Most  of  the  carbon  pricing schemes have taken place in the OECD countries. The limited application of carbon pricing instruments in developing, and emerging economies may be due to political economy constraints  (Campiglio 2016; Finon 2019). Carbon pricing had a sizeable impact on emissions , e.g. the EU </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id3735_1">ETS</a><span> impacts emissions from electricity in Germany (Sch&#228;fer 2019) and manufacturing in France (Colmer et al.), respectively.

While solar PV based on  semi-conductors constructed  from  wafers of  silicon  still  captures  90% of  the market,  new designs and materials have the potential to reduce costs further, increase efficiency, reduce resource use, and open new applications. The most significant technological advance within silicon PV in the past ten years has been the widespread adoption of the passivated emitter and rear cell (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id4980_1">PERC</a><span>) design (Green 2015), which now accounts for the majority of production. This advance boosts efficiency over traditional  aluminium  backing  by  increasing  reflectivity  within  the  cell  and  reducing  electron  hole recombination (Blakers 2019). Bifacial modules increase efficiency by using reflected light from the ground or roof on the backside of modules (Guerrero-Lemus et al. 2016). Integrating PV into buildings can reduce overall costs and improve building energy performance (Shukla et al. 2016). Concentrating PV  uses  lenses  or  mirrors that  collect  and  concentrate  light  onto  high  efficiency  PV  cells  (Li  et  al. 2020a).

The main challenges are raising the efficiency and  improving  their  lifetime  (Ma  et  al.  2020;  Riede  et  al.  2021).  Quantum  dots,  spherical  semi-conductor  nano-crystals,  can  be  tuned  to  absorb  specific  wavelengths  of  sunlight  giving  them  the potential for high efficiency with very little material use (Kramer et al. 2015).

Lithium-ion batteries, in particular, can store energy and power in small volumes and with low weight, making them the default choice for </span></li></ul></li><li>PTES<ul><li><span>Thermal energy storage refers to a range of technologies exploiting the ability of materials to absorb and store heat or cold, either within the same phase (sensible TES), through phase changes (latent TES), or through reversible chemical reactions (thermochemical TES). Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id13337_1">PTES</a><span>), a hybrid form of TES, is an air-driven electricity storage technology storing  both  heat  and  cold  in  gravel  beds,  using  a  reversible  heat-pump  system  to  maintain  the temperature difference between the two beds and gas compression to generate and transfer heat (Regen 2017).  TES  technologies  can  store  both  heat  and  cold  energy  for  long  periods,  for  example  in underground water reservoirs for balancing between seasons  (Tian et al. 2019; Dahash et al. 2019), storing heat and cold to balance daily and seasonal temperatures in buildings and reducing heat build-up in applications generating excessive waste heat, such as data centres and underground operations. </span></li></ul></li><li>LOHCs<ul><li><span>be combined with carbon and transported as a synthetic hydrocarbons (Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018) (IRENA 2019d) as well as be transported via liquid organic hydrogen carriers (</span><a href="chap6_index.html#id14615_1">LOHCs</a><span>) or ammonia (IRENA 2019d).

Hydrogen  produced  from electrolysis could also be seen as an electricity energy carrier. This is an example of the PtX processes (section 6.4.4), entailing the conversion of electricity to other energy carriers for subsequent use. </span></li><li><span>Hydrogen  can  be  liquefied  and  transported  at  volume  over  the  ocean  without  pressurization.  This requires a temperature of &#8211;253&#186;C and is therefore energy-intensive and costly (Niermann et al. 2021). Once  it  reaches  its  destination,  the  hydrogen  needs  to  be  re-gasified,  adding  further  cost.  A demonstration  project  is  under  development  exporting  liquid  hydrogen  from  Australia  to  Japan (Yamashita  et  al.  2019).  Hydrogen  could  also  be  transported  as  ammonia  by  ocean  in  liquid  form. Ammonia is advantageous because it is easier to store than hydrogen  (Zamfirescu and Dincer 2008; Nam  et  al.  2018;  Soloveichik  2016).  Liquid  ammonia  requires  temperatures  below  &#8211;33&#186;C  and  is therefore more straightforward and less costly to transport than liquified hydrogen and even liquified natural gas (Singh and Sahu 2018). A project exporting ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan is under consideration  (Nagashima  2018).  </span><a href="chap6_index.html#id14753_1">LOHCs</a><span>  could  also  be  used  to  transport  hydrogen  at  ambient temperature and pressure.
