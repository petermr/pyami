In  scenarios  limiting  warming  to  1.5&#176;C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  (likely  below  2&#176;C), electricity supplies 48% to 58% (36% to 47%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. </span></li></ul></li><li>DACCS<ul><li><span> removal (e.g., </span><a href="fulltext.annot.html#id759_1">DACCS</a><span>, </span></li></ul></li><li>BECCS<ul><li><span>, </span><a href="fulltext.annot.html#id759_4">BECCS</a><span>) to offset any residual emissions.
