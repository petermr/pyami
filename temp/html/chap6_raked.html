The physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, refineries, </span><a style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px; background-color: pink;" id="id1484_1" class="re_match">electric transmission lines</a><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1484_2" class="re_post">, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. This includes,  for example,  rules for  trading emissions  permits,  deciding  when  particular electricity generation technologies might come  online, water management and related environmental rules that </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1501">define  the  availability  of  hydropower  or  influence  water  availability  for  cooling  power  plants, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1503">regulations  for  injecting  CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id1504">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1505_0" class="re_pref">  into  underground  reservoirs  or  disposing  of  nuclear  waste,  and  even company  policies  regarding  work  hours  or  teleworking,  which  can  have  important  implications  for </span><a style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px; background-color: pink;" id="id1505_1" class="re_match">energy demand profiles</a><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1505_3" class="re_pref">.

Energy system mitigation is as much about the challenges of societal change as it is about the challenges of changes in physical infrastructure,  technologies,  and  operations.  While  this  chapter  does  not  attempt  to  draw  a  specific boundary around all the different systems that interact with the energy system, it frequently explores these broader system interactions when assessing different mitigation options and strategies. </span></div><div style="" id="id1521"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1522">There is no single spatial scale at which energy systems might be defined and assessed. They can be assessed at the scales of homes, cities, states or provinces, countries, regions, or the entire world. These different scales are frequently both distinct with their own internal dynamics yet also connected to one another. This chapter most frequently assesses energy systems from the country and global perspective.  </span></div><div style="" id="id1527"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1528">Because the energy system is so complex, it can be hard to define particular parts of it precisely, and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1530">there may be competing definitions in the literature. For the purposes of this chapter, &#8220;energy supply&#8221; encompasses all primary energy, conversion, and transmission processes with the exception of those that use final energy to provide energy services in the end-use sectors (transport, buildings, industry and  agriculture).
