Py4AMI: create, manipulate, use CProject
----------------------------------------

Py4AMI is the largest collection of functionality in the AMI system.It contains executable code and libraries to manage complex documents.
A key structure is the corpus (CProject directory) which contains a list of subdirectories (CTrees) which themselves contain many different document features (text, tables, images, graphics.
Py4AMI can create, fill, manipulate, transform many of the components including PDF, HTML, TXT, images, CSV.

The subcommands:

  DICT <options>      # create/edit/search dictionaries

  HTML <options>      # create/edit HTML
  IPCC <options>      # customised IPCC tools
  PDF <options>       # convert PDF into HTML and images
  PROJECT <options>   # create and transform a corpus of documents

After installation, run
  py4ami <subcommand> <options>

Examples (# foo is a comment):
  py4ami        # runs help
  py4ami -h     # runs help
  py4ami PDF -h # runs PDF help
  py4ami PDF --infile foo.pdf --outdir bar/ # converts PDF to HTML
  py4ami PROJECT --project foodir/ # converts all PDF in foodir to CTrees
  py4ami IPCC --pdf2html file/ # converts pdf file to html

----------------------------------------

positional arguments:
  {DICT,GUI,HTML,IPCC,PDF,PROJECT}
                        subcommands

optional arguments:
