Last, the SEB cells offer an important benefit associated with thermal management of a battery pack. When high power is required, the SEB cells are to be heated internally (1) and operated at elevated temperatures. Assuming the environmental temperature is 25°C, and the SEB and baseline cells operate at 60° and 30°C, respectively, the SEB provides a temperature difference driving heat dissipation that is 7× larger than the baseline case. Further, the SEB cell has lower DCR at its operational temperature of 60°C (17.1 ohm·cm2 for SEB with 1 wt % TAP) than the baseline cell at 30°C (25.3 ohm·cm2), indicating ~1.5× lower heat generation at the same current. The combination of these two factors eases the burden of thermal management by a factor of approximately 10 for SEB cells.
