Overall, the novel SEB offers high safety and stability at idle conditions, demonstrated through mechanical (nail penetration), electrical (high-voltage charge), and thermal abuse (high-temperature storage). The stability of the SEB-2 cell under high voltage leads to 14.5% extra energy when it is charged to 4.4 V. It delivers 81% more discharge power and 65% more charge power while operating at 60°C. Furthermore, SEB-3 achieved >4000 cycles at 60°C while still showing signs of a healthy cell to continue operation. In addition, the high operational temperature facilitates thermal management. All these key advantages demonstrated here (high safety, high power on demand, long life, and easy thermal management) make SEB cells highly promising for widespread application to, e.g., the next-generation electric vehicles.
