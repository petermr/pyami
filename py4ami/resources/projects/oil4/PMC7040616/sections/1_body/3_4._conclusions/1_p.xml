<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this study, we synthesized Nb-doped stabilized cubic-phase LLZO powder using the conventional solid-state reaction and prepared submicron LLZNO powder using the attrition milling process. Electrolyte ceramics prepared using submicron LLZNO powder can be sintered without mother powder, which reduces the sintering temperature and shortens the sintering time. After being sintered at 1150 &#176;C for 60 min, the total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy was 3.49 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, 90.4%, and 0.316 eV, respectively. When sintered at 1200 &#176;C for 30 min, we obtained the highest total ionic conductivity of 5.09 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the relative density was 87.3%, and the smallest activation energy was 0.311 eV. For the quasi-solid-state batteries assembled with submicron LLZNO powder, the capacity retention rate was 99.15% and the specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g after 50 cycles at room temperature with a current density of 0.02 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, we have presented a simple method to reduce the waste of raw materials and energy used when sintering LLZO ceramics. At the same time, the prepared submicron LLZO powder can also be applied in quasi-solid-state batteries, with a good electrochemical performance.</p>
