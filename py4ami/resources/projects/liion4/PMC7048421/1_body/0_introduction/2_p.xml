<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This work describes a new strategy to achieve both safe and energy-dense battery (SEB) cells, as schematically sketched in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, where the cell resistance is plotted against the inverse of temperature. First, a passivated cell is judiciously designed and built by using highly stable materials and by creating exceptionally stable EEIs, as characterized by higher charge-transfer resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>) and higher direct-current resistance (DCR). This is illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> by the line from point a (the conventional Li-ion cell design) to point b (the SEB cell design). It follows that these resistive SEB cells are inherently stable and safe, as demonstrated by nail penetration, short circuiting, and high-temperature storage. Second, in order for SEB cells to deliver high power during operation, they are heated instantaneously before operation, say from room temperature to 60&#176;C, so as to recover acceptable operational DCR and ultimately battery power, going from point b (at room temperature) to point c (at an elevated temperature such as 60&#176;C) in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. This power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation is opposed to standby power in the present-day LIB cells, where the high-power EEIs need to be ever present. Rapid cell heating at a speed of 1&#176; to 5&#176;C/s has been made possible by a self-heating structure discovered by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), in which a micrometer-thick nickel foil is inserted in a stack of anode-separator-cathode assemblies for uniform and internal heating. Thus, heating from room temperature to 60&#176;C for battery operation conveniently takes only 10 to 20 s.</p>
