The cathodes were prepared by coating an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone-based–based slurry onto 15-μm-thick Al foil, whose dry material consists of NCM622 (91.5 wt %), Super-P (TIMCAL) (4.1 wt %), and polyvinylidene fluoride (Arkema) (4.4 wt %) as a binder. The anodes were prepared by coating deionized water–based slurry onto 10-μm-thick Cu foil, whose dry material consists of graphite (95.4 wt %), Super-P (1.0 wt %), styrene-butadiene rubber (Zeon) (2.2 wt %), and carboxymethyl cellulose (Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku) (1.4 wt %).
