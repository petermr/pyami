<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> presents the relative interfacial reactivity as derived from the charge-transfer resistance of EIS results. This further confirms that increased operational temperature effectively decreases the charge-transfer resistance of SEB cells and consequently increases the cell reactivity and power. The reactivity boost over the baseline LIB cell is 2.06 for SEB-2. Overall, both relative power and relative reactivity illustrate the ability of SEB cells to achieve high power on demand. On the other hand, the values of relative reactivity of these two cells shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> indicate that the SEB cell will be 5&#215; safer and undergo 5&#215; less aging at room temperature, which is supported by self-discharge and capacity retention tests displayed in fig. S2. Furthermore, the comparison of relative reactivity for the two cell types at 60&#176;C indicates that the SEB cell is more than 2&#215; less prone to thermal runaway.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The use of the TAP additives altered the EEI compositions markedly. We performed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the graphite and NCM electrodes after 4021 cycles and compared the EEI structure of the samples from the baseline cell after 956 cycles. At the graphite anode, the TAP-containing electrolyte-derived SEI contains high concentrations of C, O, and P elements, compared to the control sample of the baseline cell (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and fig. S5). In addition, a higher content of C&#9472;C species in the entire C-containing species was also found in the TAP-containing electrolyte-derived SEI, suggesting the decomposition of the TAP at the anode (fig. S5). Meanwhile, the composition of the cathode CEI was also changed. With the TAP additive, the SEI layer has more C, P, and F and less Li and O, compared to the baseline SEI (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and fig. S5). High contents of LiF and P-containing species (O&#9472;P&#9552;O, Li<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>OF<sub>z</sub>, and Li<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>F<sub>z</sub>) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>) were found in the cathode CEI layer, owing to the use of the TAP additive (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). A detailed peak interpretation is as follows: peaks at 284.6, 286.1, 288.8, and 290.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum are attributed to C&#9472;C, C&#9472;O, O&#9472;C&#9552;O, and poly(O&#9472;C&#9552;O) (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>), respectively; peaks at 684.6 eV in the F 1s spectrum are attributed to LiF; peaks at 686.9 eV in the F 1s spectrum and 136.7 eV in the P 2p spectrum are attributed to O&#9472;P&#9552;O and Li<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>OF<sub>z</sub>; and peaks at 686.3 eV in the F 1s spectrum and 134.5 eV in the P 2p spectrum are attributed to Li<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>F<sub>z</sub>. In comparing O 1s spectrum of the aged baseline (956 cycles) and SEB-3 electrodes (4021 cycles), the peak at 529.2 eV for SEB-3 cathode is effectively eliminated in comparison to that for the baseline cathode (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This indicates that less lattice oxygen of NCM622 is detected for SEB-3 cathode attendant to a relatively thicker CEI layer. This is consistent with the thicker CEI layer detected by Xia <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>) on the coated NMC442 surface in the presence of TAP additive. Thus, the XPS result confirms that the TAP additive leads to a thick CEI layer and, in consequence, slower crack evolution, less gas generation, and longer cycle life.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The addition of the nickel foil increases cell mass by 1.3%, while the ratio of DCRs in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Eq. 1</xref> is the relative power presented in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> at 60&#176;C. On the basis of these values, the power density is not reduced but rather increased by a factor of 2.02, 1.79, and 1.37 in the case of SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3, respectively. Thus, in the case of SEB-3 with the highest internal resistance, the power density is still 37% higher than the baseline cell operated at room temperature.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The three SEB cells show very close rates of capacity fade within 1000 cycles (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Beyond 1000 cycles, SEB-3 shows a much lower rate of capacity fade than the other two SEB cells, as expected from its lowest reactivity. In comparison with the baseline cell, the stability and long cycle life of SEB cells are clearly evident, the reasons of which can be delineated from the differences in the capacity retention trend at various stages of aging. For the baseline cell, we see a sharp decrease in C/3 capacity retention during the initial stage and a slow decrease in the secondary stage. This is primarily attributed to the loss of lithium inventory during the quick and slow growth of the SEI layer. For the SEB cells, the capacity fade is linear with cycle number, indicating that there is no quick growth in the initial stage of aging as SEI layer growth is suppressed by in situ formation of the flame-retardant protective layer. Moreover, a sharp, nonlinear capacity loss due to lithium plating can usually be observed in the baseline cell at room temperature and at low temperatures in final stages of cell aging (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). In all SEB cells operated at 60&#176;C, this lithium plating-induced capacity loss is, however, absent, indicative of no lithium plating in SEB cells. The SEB cell free of Li plating offers a significant improvement in safety over conventional LIB cells.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The tremendous extension of cycle life of the SEB over the baseline cell may stem from the denser and more stabilized SEI layer formed on graphite particles and CEI layer on NCM622 particles in the presence of the electrolyte additives. For the baseline cell, the nickel-rich NCM particles are prone to microcracks along grain boundaries (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>) that provide gaps for electrolyte penetration and lead to more severe electrolyte oxidation and rock salt formation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Particle cracking also sets free new, fresh surface area from which oxygen can be released (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). The microcracks on NCM622 particles for the baseline cell are observed after only 50 cycles (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The formation of cracks becomes much more notable throughout the micrograph domain after 956 cycles (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). For the SEB cells, cracks on NCM particles are not observed at 50 cycles, and a small amount of cracks are observed after 4021 cycles (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). The presence of microcracks not only causes a loss of contact but also accelerates NCM capacity fade. For the SEB cells, the polymer coating from TAP likely forms a robust CEI, reducing formation of microcracks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This is also evidenced by optical images (fig. S4) and no observable cell deformation or swelling after 4021 cycles even at an elevated temperature of 60&#176;C.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Beyond safety and high power, there is an ever-increasing need for long cycle life of LIBs. Low-reactivity SEB cells built with highly stable materials offer longer calendar life (fig. S2), evident from the slow capacity fade when the battery is in idle conditions at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, cycling of SEB cells is also stable. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> compares capacity retention of the baseline cell with SEB cells during cycling at 60&#176;C of 1C CC charge to 4.2 V CV charge till C/20 and then 1C discharge to 2.8 V. Clearly, the SEB cells outperform the baseline cell as evidenced by a 20% capacity loss at 481 cycles with visible signs of cell deformation due to gas evolution and graphite anode swelling for the baseline cell, while SEB-3 can achieve 2821 cycles before reaching 20% capacity loss. This corresponds to ca. 6&#215; improvement in cycle life. In addition, SEB-3 achieves 4014 cycles at 75% capacity retention while still showing signs of a healthy cell capable of cycling stably (no perceptible gassing or lithium plating). The average discharge capacity of these 4014 cycles is 84.2% of an equivalent full cycle (EFC). Assuming a 153-mile driving range per EFC for an electric vehicle (e.g., 2019 BMW i3), the 4014 cycles mean &gt;517,000 miles of lifetime. That is more than 5&#215; the warranty for commercial electric cars (e.g., BMW i3, 70% capacity for 8 years or 100,000 miles). Improvement of cell lifetime can be further demonstrated by considering the rate of capacity fade during calendar aging at room temperature (i.e., the stable state), which is 7&#215; lower than that at 60&#176;C (the reactive state). The SEB cell will only be heated to the reactive state for situations requiring high power or fast charging. The greater part of its lifetime (&gt;90%) would be spent in idle conditions (the stable state). Therefore, in the field, the SEB cycle life is expected to extend much beyond 4014 cycles before reaching 25% capacity loss.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because of the high-voltage tolerance of SEB cells, when charged to a high voltage of 4.4 V as compared to 4.2 V, the SEB cell discharge capacity increases 12.7%, and its discharge energy increases 14.5% (fig. S1B). Thus, the high-voltage tolerance can be used to increase cell energy density.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">PolyTAP and its composites are flame-retardant materials. In addition, the PolyTAP has electrically insulative properties and stability at elevated temperatures (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). All these properties make PolyTAP well suited to enhance the safety of SEB cells under abuse conditions. This is confirmed by nail penetration tests shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, where the temperature rise is only 100&#176;C (without cell deformation, smoking, or fire) versus almost 1000&#176;C (catching fire) in the baseline case (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The superior safety performance of the SEB cell is further illustrated by the electrical performance of the cell during nail penetration. For the baseline cell, the cell voltage decreases to 0.1 V within 5 s after the nail penetration. The sharp voltage drop indicates that the shorting current is extremely high due to low internal resistance of the baseline cell. In contrast, the voltage of the SEB cell drops from 4.171 to 3.085 V within 5 s after penetration, showing a slow and controlled discharge due to the high internal resistance of the SEB cell. The substantially higher resistance in the SEB cell than the baseline is caused by the electrically nonconductive layers formed on the surface of the graphite and NCM particles, as schematically shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As a proof of concept, we prepare a baseline cell composed of a standard electrolyte, 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (3/7 wt) + 2 weight % (wt %) vinylene carbonate (VC), and a graphite anode and an NCM622 cathode. Protective layers of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are formed during initial charge/discharge cycles. To yield low DCR and hence high power, these interfacial layers are usually thin, lacking sufficient density and resilience to resist decomposition under abuse conditions, to suppress continuous reaction of the solvent EC in the SEI, or to hinder continuous oxidation of EC with oxygen released from cathode materials in the CEI, thereby leading to Li consumption and loss of cell capacity. In contrast, in SEB cells, we create highly stable, flame-retardant EEIs through the addition of a small amount of TAP in the standard electrolyte. This electrolyte modification is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction of EC content, i.e., EC/EMC (1/9 wt) + 2 wt % VC, intended for further reduction in gas production via side reactions. In this work, we present results for three prototype SEB cells, identified as SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3 and corresponding to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt % TAP, respectively. The charge-transfer resistance of the SEB cells, measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), increases by 3&#215; to 5&#215; as compared to the baseline cell without the electrolyte additives, as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>. The high impedance comes from the polymerization of TAP molecules that form thick and dense interfacial films at the surfaces of both the anode and cathode (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). On the anode side, the film serves as an enhanced SEI layer to stabilize further growth. On the cathode side, the film hinders EC in the electrolyte from reacting with lattice oxygen on the NCM surface at high temperature or high voltage (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), as shown schematically in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">With the introduction of new materials into the electrolyte, the effect on cell cost, weight, and fabrication should be evaluated. The electrolyte additive, TAP, has a comparable price and density when compared to current standard solvents; thus, no notable material cost difference is expected with the introduction of SEB electrolytes. Unlike superconcentrated electrolytes (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>), the electrolytes with TAP do not increase the viscosity compared to the standard electrolyte. From a fabrication perspective, the SEB electrolytes will also add no additional cost due to the similarity in processing during and after introduction into a cell.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A distinctive feature of SEB cells is high power on demand. When batteries are not in operation, SEB cells are left idle at room temperature, exhibiting high stability and safety. However, upon operation, a SEB cell switches to high-reactivity conditions through rapid thermal stimulation. This can be illustrated through DCR, which is inversely proportional to power performance. Here, DCRs upon discharge and charge for SEB and baseline LIB cells are measured at 50% SOC by a 10-s hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) method. As expected, the DCR values increase substantially by adding a small amount of TAP in the electrolyte, as shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 (A and B)</xref>, which also demonstrates that adding more TAP in SEB-3 (e.g., 1.5 wt %) results in a further increase in DCR, owing to the formation of thicker protective layers.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> shows the relative power of SEB cells versus the baseline LIB, where the power of the baseline cell at room temperature is normalized to be unity, thus demonstrating that SEB cells can provide sufficient, higher power by operating at higher temperatures. At 50% SOC, SEB-1 operated at 29.2&#176;C provides the same power as the baseline cell at room temperature. The safest cell, SEB-3, with 1.5 wt % TAP additive requires an operation temperature of 44.6&#176;C to deliver the same power as the baseline cell at room temperature. The baseline cell has a narrow temperature window of 15&#176; to 35&#176;C, whereas the SEB cells have much higher maximum operating temperature without becoming excessively reactive. Thus, the necessity of higher temperature operation for power recovery does not pose an issue for SEB cells. At 50% SOC, the discharge power boost over the baseline Li-ion cell is 2.05, 1.81, and 1.39 for the SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, at the ambient temperature of 0&#176;C, the baseline LIB cell has a relative power of 0.38, while SEB-2 has a relative power of 1.81 when operated at 60&#176;C [it takes 30 s to heat up a cell from 0&#176; to 60&#176;C at a speed of 2&#176;C/s, typical of the self-heating structure of Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>)]. This is ~5&#215; boost in power over the LIB cell for SEB cells working in the freezing environments. Generally, SEB cells perform independent of ambient temperatures or weather, as they are always heated up in a matter of seconds and operate at a constant elevated temperature. Although heating a cell to an elevated temperature consumes cell energy, the total deliverable energy of a cell, counterintuitively, is not reduced. As shown in fig. S3, the C/3 discharge energy was 9.62 watt-hours (Wh) for the baseline cell at room temperature and 10.15 Wh for the SEB-3 cell at 60&#176;C. According to our previous work (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), it takes ~1% cell energy for a 10&#176;C temperature rise, meaning that the SEB-3 cell needs 3.5% of its energy for heating from 25&#176; to 60&#176;C; the remaining discharge energy is thus 9.79 Wh, which is 2% higher than that of the baseline cell at room temperature.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For the baseline cell, the capacity loss at elevated temperatures is mainly due to SEI growth on the anode side and solvent oxidation on the cathode side. As a consequence, the DCR increases markedly with cycle number (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the case of SEB cells, the DCR of the fresh cell is initially much larger than the baseline cell; however, its rate of increase is much slower due to the protective coating on both the anode and cathode (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 (C and D)</xref> shows discharge curves of the fresh SEB cell versus the aged cell, respectively. Because of its DCR increase with cycle number, SEB-3 shows slight power fade after 2821 cycles at 60&#176;C. In contrast, the baseline cell shows a drastic DCR increase and, hence, substantial power loss within only 556 cycles (fig. S6). For all the SEB cells with TAP additive, their DCRs increase linearly and increased additive content leads to higher DCR in fresh cells but slower DCR evolution with cycle number (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The SEB cells do not produce gas during cycling tests, yielding more safety than the baseline cell. In addition, cells containing TAP produce less gas during formation than the baseline cell (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>).</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Last, the SEB cells offer an important benefit associated with thermal management of a battery pack. When high power is required, the SEB cells are to be heated internally (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>) and operated at elevated temperatures. Assuming the environmental temperature is 25&#176;C, and the SEB and baseline cells operate at 60&#176; and 30&#176;C, respectively, the SEB provides a temperature difference driving heat dissipation that is 7&#215; larger than the baseline case. Further, the SEB cell has lower DCR at its operational temperature of 60&#176;C (17.1 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup> for SEB with 1 wt % TAP) than the baseline cell at 30&#176;C (25.3 ohm&#183;cm<sup>2</sup>), indicating ~1.5&#215; lower heat generation at the same current. The combination of these two factors eases the burden of thermal management by a factor of approximately 10 for SEB cells.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The electrolytes for SEB cells were formulated by reducing EC content and adding TAP as an additive. Although EC is an essential solvent for SEI layer formation, it also leads to gas generation, especially at high voltage (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Calendar aging testing shows that high-temperature and high-SOC conditions accelerate capacity fade and increase in internal resistance while also promoting gas generation. SEB cells initially contains 10 wt % EC in the electrolyte. Some EC is consumed during the formation cycle, resulting in an EC content much less than 10% in formed SEB cells. This is advantageous since the rate of gas generation in an EC-less electrolyte would be lower than that in an electrolyte with high EC content.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There is another advantage of SEB cells promising for ultralong cycle life when deployed in the field. While conventional LIB cells undergo a large environmental temperature swing, the SEB cells almost always operate at a single, constant temperature (say 60&#176;C) regardless of ambient temperatures and after an extremely short period of initial transition by self-heating (on the order of tens of seconds). The latter feature guarantees minimal damage of battery materials in SEB cells caused by wide temperature variations.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The stability and safety of SEB cells are further evident in high-voltage charge and high-temperature calendar life tests (figs. S1 and S2). The SEB cells can undergo 1254 exposures to high-voltage abuse [constant current (CC) charge to 4.4 V, constant voltage (CV) to C/20] at 40&#176;C with a capacity retention of 80%, whereas the baseline cell sustains only 40 cycles at the same capacity loss and operating temperature, indicating that the SEB cell is &gt;30&#215; more stable and hence safer than the baseline cells under high-voltage charging conditions. Calendar life testing further shows that the passivated SEB cells can effectively suppress self-discharge. The self-discharge current is measured by holding the cell voltage constant at a required value, such as 4.187 V for 100% state of charge (SOC). Both baseline and SEB cells display a fast decrease of self-discharge current density in the beginning of calendar aging due to anode SEI layer growth. Fresh SEB cells show self-discharging currents ~5&#215; lower than the baseline cell at room temperature and 50% SOC, 6&#215; lower at room temperature and 100% SOC, and ~7&#215; lower at 60&#176;C at both 50 and 100% SOC. After 60 days of storage, the self-discharge current begins to plateau; however, the self-discharge current in the SEB cell is still 2&#215; lower than that in the baseline cell at room temperature and 50% SOC and 3&#215; lower at room temperature and 100% SOC. The self-discharge becomes 4&#215; lower at high temperature (60&#176;C) at both 50 and 100% SOC, indicating that at elevated temperatures, the SEB cells maintain superiority in calendar life over the baseline cell.</p>

A forced-air oven was used to control different ambient temperatures. For each aging cycle, the cell was charged to 4.2 V at a constant current of 2.8 A (1C-rate) and then charged at a constant voltage of 4.2 V until the current decreased to 0.14 A (C/20). After resting for 5 min, the cell was discharged to 2.8 V at a constant current of 2.8 A (1C-rate) followed by a final rest period of 5 min. When the aging cycle number reached a specific value (e.g., 403, 1006 cycles), the cell was cycled at a charge and discharge rate of C/3 to determine the capacity (designated as C/3 capacity) of the cell. For impedance tests at different temperatures, the cells were fully charged and then discharged at a rate of C/3 to 90% SOC. Impedance testing was performed with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 50 kHz to 0.005 Hz.

<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">More broadly, the proposed strategy of passivating a battery cell for safety in idle conditions and then self-heating for high power before operation has a profound impact on future directions of battery materials development. Within the SEB framework, the high reactivity of active materials and electrolytes as well as of EEIs is no longer a requirement. The only requirement is stability at elevated temperatures. Such a design strategy will lead to dormant cell performance at low temperatures or even low power at room temperature, but all these deficiencies can be circumvented by the self-heating structure (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), which will take a SEB cell from low or room temperature to an elevated temperature suitable for high power output in tens of seconds. On the other hand, these SEB cells enjoy ultrahigh safety and ultralow degradation under all scenarios as well as robust cycling stability at elevated temperatures. We hope that this unconventional strategy will unleash a vast class of new materials for development of a disruptive generation of LIBs.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Overall, the novel SEB offers high safety and stability at idle conditions, demonstrated through mechanical (nail penetration), electrical (high-voltage charge), and thermal abuse (high-temperature storage). The stability of the SEB-2 cell under high voltage leads to 14.5% extra energy when it is charged to 4.4 V. It delivers 81% more discharge power and 65% more charge power while operating at 60&#176;C. Furthermore, SEB-3 achieved &gt;4000 cycles at 60&#176;C while still showing signs of a healthy cell to continue operation. In addition, the high operational temperature facilitates thermal management. All these key advantages demonstrated here (high safety, high power on demand, long life, and easy thermal management) make SEB cells highly promising for widespread application to, e.g., the next-generation electric vehicles.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In the context of electric vehicles, introduction of the SEB yields a substantial gain in energy density and cost reduction at the pack level due to (i) simplified or entirely eliminated thermal management system; (ii) enhanced safety of SEB cells, thus enabling removal of some or all safety devices installed in a battery pack; and (iii) simplified battery management system due to SEB cells always operating at a single, constant temperature, rendering estimation of SOC, state of power, state of health, etc. oversimplified. We believe that 25 to 30% gain in energy density and 30% reduction in cost for SEB battery packs are possible without introducing new chemistry or cell manufacturing.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in electrified vehicles, consumer electronics, and stationary energy storage systems. Simultaneous realization of high safety and high energy density/performance is a perpetual pursuit. Unfortunately, conventional batteries are passive devices where the performance, safety, and calendar/cycle life are all dictated by the electrochemical reactivity at ever-present anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interfaces. An inherent conflict between the reactivity and stability of battery materials persists at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces (EEIs). More specifically, highly reactive electrode/electrolyte materials provide high power and high performance but result in poor safety and accelerated degradation even when the battery is not in use. Highly stable (i.e., less reactive) electrode/electrolyte materials give rise to battery safety, low degradation, low self-discharge, and long life, but such materials offer low power and performance. As a result, materials development for batteries has always aimed at trade-offs of finding electrode and electrolyte materials that are not too reactive but also not too stable.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This work describes a new strategy to achieve both safe and energy-dense battery (SEB) cells, as schematically sketched in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, where the cell resistance is plotted against the inverse of temperature. First, a passivated cell is judiciously designed and built by using highly stable materials and by creating exceptionally stable EEIs, as characterized by higher charge-transfer resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>) and higher direct-current resistance (DCR). This is illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> by the line from point a (the conventional Li-ion cell design) to point b (the SEB cell design). It follows that these resistive SEB cells are inherently stable and safe, as demonstrated by nail penetration, short circuiting, and high-temperature storage. Second, in order for SEB cells to deliver high power during operation, they are heated instantaneously before operation, say from room temperature to 60&#176;C, so as to recover acceptable operational DCR and ultimately battery power, going from point b (at room temperature) to point c (at an elevated temperature such as 60&#176;C) in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. This power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation is opposed to standby power in the present-day LIB cells, where the high-power EEIs need to be ever present. Rapid cell heating at a speed of 1&#176; to 5&#176;C/s has been made possible by a self-heating structure discovered by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), in which a micrometer-thick nickel foil is inserted in a stack of anode-separator-cathode assemblies for uniform and internal heating. Thus, heating from room temperature to 60&#176;C for battery operation conveniently takes only 10 to 20 s.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To achieve the requisite stable, robust EEIs, the additive, triallyl phosphate (TAP), is used in this work based on sufficient evidence in the literature of its ability to improve cell stability at both high-voltage and high-temperature conditions. For example, in 2015, Xia <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>) demonstrated that a TAP-based electrolyte forms thick protective layers on both electrodes in graphite/NCM442-based cells as evidenced by reduced self-discharge at high temperatures, reduced gas production during high-temperature cycling, and increased <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>. Although TAP has been explored previously, it is chosen in the present work to create resistive Li-ion cells as an example to illustrate the concept of realizing high safety and high performance simultaneously. Other ways to build resistive cells, such as using electrode materials of low Brunauer-Emmett-Teller areas, are effective as well.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We present a novel concept to achieve high performance and high safety simultaneously by passivating a Li-ion cell and then self-heating before use. By adding a small amount of triallyl phosphate in conventional electrolytes, we show that resistances of the passivated cells can increase by ~5&#215;, thereby ensuring high safety and thermal stability. High power before battery operation is delivered by self-heating to an elevated temperature such as 60&#176;C within tens of seconds. The present approach of building a resistive cell with highly stable materials and then delivering high power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation leads to a revolutionary route to high safety when batteries are not in use and high battery performance upon operation.</p>

This indicates that high-performance LLZNO ceramics are obtained when sintered at high temperatures only for short sintering times. However, the total ionic conductivity and relative density of ceramic pellets decreased and impure phases occurred when the sintering time was prolonged at 1100 and 1200 &#176;C.

The value of D<sub>(3,2)</sub> (0.575 &#181;m) is similar to that of D<sub>(4,3)</sub> (0.607 &#181;m), which indicates that the prepared powder had a uniform particle-size distribution.

Meanwhile, the total ionic conductivity was lower when the AGGs were bigger. This was due to the submicron LLZNO powder having a high sintering activity, which made the crystal grain of the LLZNO ceramics have a high specific surface energy during the high-temperature sintering process, and promoted rapid grain growth and ceramic densification in the sintering process. For the above reasons, the growth rate of the grains was higher than the migration rate of the pores at the grain boundaries when the sintering temperature was higher and the sintering time was longer and the pores could not be discharged from the grain boundaries and finally stay on the inside of the AGGs. As a result, the bulk impedance of the crystal grains increased, and the total ion conductivity was reduced. However, although the submicron LLZNO powder had high sintering activity, the growth of grains could not be entirely promoted in a shorter sintering time and at a lower temperature. Therefore, a mass of grains which stayed in the initial state are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>d (SL4, 1100 &#176;C &#215; 60 min), and this was disadvantageous for lithium-ionic conduction due to the incomplete surface of the LLZNO grains after the attrition milling process. Eventually, the ceramic pellets showed a lower total ionic conductivity (0.51 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>).

A highest ionic conductivity of 5.09 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was obtained, which indicates that the submicron LLZNO powder had a higher sintering activity and high total ionic conductivity LLZNO ceramic pellets could be obtained by sintered at a high temperature for only a short time.

The capacity of the batteries increased in the early stage of the galvanostatic charge&#8210;discharge test, which may be caused by the activation of positive material.

Eur. 5.0) [<bold><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></bold>], the minimum content of EO in T. vulgaris is 12 mL/kg, but the chemical composition shows variations, six chemotypes being mainly reported, namely geraniol, linalool, gamma-terpineol, carvacrol, thymol and trans-thujan-4-ol/terpinen-4-ol [<bold><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></bold>]. Both the isolation yield and the chemical composition of the EOs are dependent on a number of factors, such as the environment, growth region and cultivation practices [<bold><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></bold>]. In addition to the flavoring properties determined by the constitutive active ingredients, the thyme EO exhibits significant antimicrobial activity [<bold><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></bold>-<bold><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></bold>] as well as strong antioxidant properties [<bold><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></bold>].</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry</bold>. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a HP6890 instrument coupled with a HP 5973 mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph is equipped with a split-splitless injector and a Factor FourTM VF-35ms 5% fenil-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 &#956;m film thickness capillary column. Gas chromatography conditions include a temperature range of 50 to 250&#176;C at 40&#176;C/min, with a solvent delay of 5 min. The injector was maintained at a temperature of 250&#176;C. The inert gas was helium at a flow of 1.0 mL/min, and the injected volume in the splitless mode was 1 &#956;L. The MS conditions were the following: ionization energy, 70 eV; quadrupole temperature, 100&#176;C; scanning velocity, 1.6 scan/s; weight range, 40-500 amu.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>Raw material</bold>. Thyme was harvested during the flowering season (July 2012) from the area around the Bro&#351;teni commune &#8211; Mehedin&#355;i County, Romania. The plant material was dried in well-ventilated areas, sheltered from direct sunlight and then stored in double-layered paper bags at temperatures of 3-5&#176;C until processing. A voucher specimen (V.FPT-451) was deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy, &#8220;Victor Babe&#537;&#8221; University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timi&#537;oara, Romania.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>Determination of antimicrobial activity</bold>. Thyme EO was tested on 7 common food-related bacteria and fungus: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13882), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), using the disk diffusion method as previously described [<bold><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></bold>]. Briefly, a suspension of the tested microorganism (10^6 cells/mL-1) was spread on the solid media plates (Mueller-Hinton agar for bacteria and Sabouraud cloramphenicol agar for fungi). The paper discs (Whatman No 1 filter paper - 6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 5, 10, 15 and 20&#181;L EO and placed on the inoculated agar. The plates inoculated with bacterial strains were incubated for 24 h at 37&#176;C and 48 h at 30&#176;C for fungi, respectively. As positive controls, ciprofloxacin (30 &#181;g/disk) and cephalexin (10 &#181;g/disk) were used for bacterial strains and fluconazole (10 &#181;g/disk) for fungi. After incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters. Each test was performed in triplicate on at least three separate experiments.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>Isolation of essential oils</bold>. The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation, according to Ph. Eur. 5.0 [<bold><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></bold>], by using a modified Clevenger apparatus (with the EO collection area cooled to prevent the emergence of artifacts). The EO was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) and stored in a tightly sealed brown glass bottle at 0-4&#176;C for testing.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><bold>Statistical analysis</bold>. The statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS Version 21 (IBM Corp., NY). The mean inhibition zone for each group of nine observations was compared with the value of the disc diameter (6 mm) using the t-test. The GLM procedure was used to conduct a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the inhibition zones. The type of microorganism and amount of essential oil were used as factors in the full factorial model. Post-hoc tests for each amount of essential oil were conducted by using Tukey&#8217;s HSD method, in order to compare the effect on different types of microorganisms.</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The percent composition of the volatile compounds was calculated. The qualitative analysis was based on the percent area of each peak of the sample compounds. The mass spectrum of each compound was compared with the mass spectrum from the NIST 98 spectrum library (USA National Institute of Science and Technology software).</p>
<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The study was designed to determine the chemical composition and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris cultivated in Romania. The essential oil was isolated in a yield of 1.25% by steam distillation from the aerial part of the plant and subsequently analyzed by GC-MS. The major components were p-cymene (8.41%), &#947;-terpinene (30.90%) and thymol (47.59%). Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated on 7 common food-related bacteria and fungus by using the disk diffusion method. The results demonstrate that the Thymus vulgaris essential oil tested possesses strong antimicrobial properties, and may in the future represent a new source of natural antiseptics with applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry.</p>

<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><p>We present a novel concept to achieve high performance and high safety simultaneously by passivating a Li-ion cell and then self-heating before use. By adding a small amount of triallyl phosphate in conventional electrolytes, we show that resistances of the passivated cells can increase by ~5&#215;, thereby ensuring high safety and thermal stability. High power before battery operation is delivered by self-heating to an elevated temperature such as 60&#176;C within tens of seconds. The present approach of building a resistive cell with highly stable materials and then delivering high power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation leads to a revolutionary route to high safety when batteries are not in use and high battery performance upon operation.</p></abstract>
<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><p>The garnet Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) has been widely investigated because of its high conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and chemical stability with regards to lithium metal. However, the usual preparation process of LLZO requires high-temperature sintering for a long time and a lot of mother powder to compensate for lithium evaporation. In this study submicron Li<sub>6.6</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.6</sub>Nb<sub>0.4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZNO) powder&#8213;which has a stable cubic phase and high sintering activity&#8213;was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction and the attrition milling process, and Li stoichiometric LLZNO ceramics were obtained by sintering this powder&#8213;which is difficult to control under high sintering temperatures and when sintered for a long time&#8213;at a relatively low temperature or for a short amount of time. The particle-size distribution, phase structure, microstructure, distribution of elements, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy of the submicron LLZNO powder and the LLZNO ceramics were tested and analyzed using laser diffraction particle-size analyzer (LD), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and the Archimedean method. The total ionic conductivity of samples sintered at 1200 &#176;C for 30 min was 5.09 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the activation energy was 0.311 eV, and the relative density was 87.3%. When the samples were sintered at 1150 &#176;C for 60 min the total ionic conductivity was 3.49 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the activation energy was 0.316 eV, and the relative density was 90.4%. At the same time, quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid-state electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g and the columbic efficiency was above 95%.</p></abstract>
