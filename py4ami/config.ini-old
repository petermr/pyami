# NOTE. All files use forward slash even on Windows
# use slash (/) to separate filename components, we will convert to path-separator automatically

# NOTE: PyAMI variables also use ${...} but to avoid being wrongly processed by ConfigParser
#       they are escaped as $${...} . They are then substituted in a PyAMI parse
#.      This ONLY happens in Config files
